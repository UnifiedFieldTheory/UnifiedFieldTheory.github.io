<h2 id="from-the-translator">From the Translator:</h2>
<p>I know you may think this is a book full of pornographic contents;
reader discretion is advised. You can also view this book as a sci-fi
somniloquy after sessions of hypnosis for healing mental trauma, as the
author lived a bad life for many years being considered a psychopath.
But if you really have an open mind, you’re in for some food for
thought. This book is the experience of a Chinese farmer abducted by a
technologically advanced extraterrestrial race. From his memory, Zhang
Xiangqian (Qian) described a civilization capable of combining the
advantages of aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms to turn their own body
into actinian-like humanoids with their consciousness uploaded to the
Cloud in order to achieve immortality thanks to their artificial field
technology and excessive IT infrastructure. However, the Guoker race
appears to be spending no effort exploring the spiritual world, so the
life experience is prioritized over all other factors, and they fully
embrace their inner dark side without any restrictions we humans need to
comply with every day for our lifetime. Zhang was experimented on and
tortured but also freed himself from indulging in the obscene Guoker
lifestyle during his visit. You may have the feeling that Guoker is a
race far from benevolent, but I suggest the point that this book allows
us to view a possible future of our human race - how our society,
especially the economy, power structure, and lifestyle of everybody,
would look like or evolve should we manage to have the technological
capability of science fiction. Whenever we choose a set of technologies,
our culture, society, lifestyle, and even the meaning of existence for
our very civilization, may be completely restructured and become solely
dependent on it. My dear readers, what’s your choice for the future?</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangqian is not an easy person to talk with. I do not know
Zhang personally and I was quite disregarded by him as we talked a few
times on WeChat. If you are interested in contacting Zhang personally,
please be tolerant. Zhang only knows how to point out your mistakes and
never tells you if he agrees with you. Don’t get frustrated if he says
you’re wrong.</p>
<p>About the translation, the truly weird part is that his writing style
is quite a middle-school standard, and he often makes spelling mistakes
unintentionally whereas his scientific and logical wordings are mostly
very accurate. (I mean using the wrong Chinese characters, which is
interestingly common among Chinese UFO contactees. I don’t think it’s
because of his dialect despite his Mandarin sounds quite bad to me.)
You’ll see that in the translation as I almost didn’t elaborate or turn
his words to be more understandable, which sometimes you may feel
awkward about the way he expresses his ideas. It’s quite hard to
understand why and how he thinks that way, being stubborn and arrogant
sometimes, and somehow mind-twisted against others.</p>
<h2 id="from-the-typesetter">From the Typesetter:</h2>
<p>There is relatively little evidence about Zhang Xiangqian’s visit to
alien planets. Currently, only the strange scar on his head (which he
said was not present before his visit), his drawings of extraterrestrial
creatures and scenes, and the formulas and memoirs he wrote after his
return. Although lacking more evidence, I deeply admire his persistence
in promoting the advanced alien technology he has seen for nearly 40
years, despite facing extreme difficulties in life. Many people believe
his persistence is due to mental problems, but I interviewed him in
person in 2023 and obtained a lot of evidence and information. I think
he is mentally normal. Apart from his extraterrestrial experience, he is
no different from any ordinary Anhui farmer.</p>
<p>The original text of this work exceeds 170 thousand words. I am very
grateful to the translator YANG Yang for his persistence and hard work.
I added the Contents and Appendix faithful to the translation and moved
the translator’s notes to the footnotes. There were a lot of additions,
omissions and mistranslations in the original translation. I spent 8
months proofreading it in my spare time, retranslating and solving these
problems. I then hired a professional translation company to proofread
it again.</p>
<p>There are many illustrations in Zhang Xiangqian’s original works,
some of which he drew by himself and the others were found online by
him. I have added those drawn by himself because of potential scientific
research value. If you are interested, you can also read the original
work “果克星球奇遇” in Chinese.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reading and support.</p>
<p>P.S. I would like to thank Chongqing Qiyi Translation Service Co.,
Ltd. for assisting in the proofreading and providing a lt of
professional advice.</p>

<h2 id="foreword-from-the-author">Foreword from the Author</h2>
<p>Around the age of seven or eight, I once found myself herding geese
on a sandy expanse, all alone, when suddenly, I saw several mist-like
formations swiftly moving before my eyes. One of them aggressively
charged towards me, causing a buzzing sound in my head and a blackout.
Overwhelmed, I instinctively crouched down, taking quite a while to
regain my senses, by which time the mist had completely dissipated.</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen any UFOs, but I do remember noticing a flash of red
light in the western sky earlier that day, roughly between the afternoon
and evening, around four or five o’clock. The red light appeared close
to the sun, which was already surrounded by many red clouds, so the idea
of UFOs or anything of the sort didn’t really cross my mind.</p>
<p>This remains one of the strangest encounters of my childhood, deeply
ingrained in my memory.</p>
<p>Starting from around the age of twelve or thirteen, I frequently
dreamt at night of living on another planet. There, the sunlight seemed
weaker, casting a bluish light. The planet was almost devoid of
vegetation and appeared inhospitable on the surface, with humanity
dwelling deep underground. We used incredibly fast modes of
transportation that moved between the surface and the underground
effortlessly.</p>
<p>What stood out most in my mind were the massive and complex
structures that spanned both above and below ground, predominantly
constructed from lead-grey metal, giving the entire planet a
monochromatic and dreary appearance.</p>
<p>Having such dreams occasionally wouldn’t be peculiar, but the
frequency and vividness of these dreams over many years have led me to
ponder their underlying reasons.</p>
<p>In my youth, I encountered numerous strange phenomena, which I now
speculate to involve extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>Particularly when I was suffering from severe nephritis during a time
of extreme poverty in my family, where hunger was a constant companion,
and members of my family had starved to death. I was on the brink of
death without any possibility of hospital treatment when, I firmly
believe, extraterrestrials saved me. This memory is particularly
vivid.</p>
<p>Another time, I was afflicted with a serious eye disease that lasted
for six months without any form of treatment. My mother, the only one
who occasionally checked on me, tried to soothe my eyes with her saliva
when I couldn’t open them. Initially, it seemed to help, but soon, it
lost its effect.</p>
<p>She didn’t have any money for hospital treatments. Back then, our
family was in dire poverty, and the general attitude was one of
ignorance and numbness to the suffering around us. The death of a child
was met with the same level of grief as if a small cat or dog had passed
away. Eventually, my condition worsened to the point where I was nearly
blind, unable to see where I was going, and could only sit by my bed all
day.</p>
<p>It was then that a group of mysterious individuals arrived and
miraculously cured my eyesight.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was taken away several times by mysterious
figures. Surprisingly, I felt no fear upon encountering them. Each time
before their arrival, I had a strong intuition, telling myself, "They
are coming, they are coming," and indeed, they always did.</p>
<p>Upon their arrival, the walls would invariably glow red. They would
whisk me away from my bed at night, effortlessly passing through the
walls, only to return me to my bed by morning. I often questioned
whether this was merely a dream.</p>
<p>One time, as they returned me, I requested to be placed on a heap of
grass in front of the village cow shed. The next morning, as expected, I
woke up on that very heap. Upon returning home, my mother, preoccupied
with her morning chores, didn’t inquire about my whereabouts.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, I found myself questioning whether these
childhood encounters were figments of my imagination. However, the
memory of sleeping on that haystack was too vivid to dismiss as a dream,
solidifying my conviction that those experiences were indeed real.</p>
<p>In the early summer of 1985, when I was 19 years old, I encountered
aliens again and traveled to an alien planet for a month.</p>
<p>The basis for my certainty that I encountered aliens in 1985 is this:
I wrote many letters to the authorities about this matter at that time,
and they all said that I was 19 years old.</p>
<p>According to our rural people’s calculation of how old they are (East
Asian age reckoning), I was born in 1967, so it should have been in
1985. Neither did I look at the calendar when I came back from the alien
planet, nor did I have any intention of looking for evidence at that
time.</p>
<p>However, on our earth, it only lasted one night. Their time is
different from ours.</p>
<p>This was the last time I met aliens. From then on, I had no contact
with aliens. Not only the contact of the meeting was gone, but also the
contact such as telepathy was gone.</p>
<p>This time my memory was also not very clear. It was possible that my
memory was disturbed by them.</p>
<p>However, by this time I was an adult and had a certain ability to
think and judge for myself, and I gained a lot of information on the
alien planet.</p>
<p>Prior to this encounter, I had delved into magazines related to alien
abductions, which primed me to recognize the possibility of encountering
these enigmatic beings during my initial interaction with them at
19.</p>
<p>The knowledge gleaned from this expedition proved invaluable and
significantly impacted the trajectory of my life. Without it, I might
have remained a conventional farmer, leading a mundane existence focused
solely on family life. The experience propelled me into realms of
inquiry about the universe’s mysteries, space-time, and cutting-edge
physics, driving me to contribute numerous articles online.</p>
<p>I was a diligent student, putting in extra effort with my studies,
but my academic performance remained average due to my lack of natural
aptitude. When it came time to graduate from junior high and move on to
senior high, there was a preliminary exam I needed to pass.
Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I failed to clear it. Even after
a year of repeating the preparation, I still couldn’t succeed. This
disappointment led to my father expressing his frustration through
physical discipline.</p>
<p>With my hopes of continuing further education dashed, I returned home
to pursue farming. Life became a cycle of labor during the day and
fishing at night, leaving little time for reading books.</p>
<p>Acquiring advanced textbooks, especially beyond the level of high
school, was nearly impossible in our rural setting. The nearby Sanhe
Town lacked such resources, limiting my access to only junior high
materials and leisure reading.</p>
<p>The source of my knowledge of cosmic mysteries and cutting-edge
physics remains a mystery to me, yet I am convinced it has some
connection to encounters with extraterrestrial beings.</p>
<p>On Earth, when a person goes on a journey and then recalls the
experience upon returning, typically, the memories unfold in the mind in
chronological order, much like watching a movie.</p>
<p>But the memories of this journey are disjointed, and the sequence of
events may have been disrupted. I don’t know what happened first and
what happened next.</p>
<p>In their world, the passage of time and the flow of events are
radically different. At a moment, you may be facing imminent danger,
only to find yourself swiftly transported by their advanced means of
conveyance, the Global Movement Web (GMW), to a place of safety and
comfort without even the need to walk through a door.</p>
<p>Their society is deeply immersed in virtualization, often blurring
the lines between what is virtual and what is real for me. At times, the
transition between actual and virtual scenarios seems to happen at
will.</p>
<p>At a time, you’re certain you’re in a virtual scene, but then,
inexplicably, it shifts into reality.</p>
<p>Similarly, you might be convinced you’re in a real setting, only for
it to suddenly morph into a virtual environment.</p>
<p>This encounter with extraterrestrials was unlike any typical alien
interaction. The vast amount of information I received from them,
especially in terms of scientific and technological knowledge, wasn’t
communicated through their language or any traditional form of
learning.</p>
<p>It felt as if there was a direct exchange of consciousness with the
aliens, as though an alien’s consciousness had merged with mine, giving
me access to fragments of their memory that I gradually came to
understand.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that they used some form of artificial field
scanning technology to implant a wealth of information into my brain
through an invisible medium, much like downloading data onto a computer.
They repeatedly scanned my brain and body with this artificial field
device, leaving me uncertain whether their goal was to impart knowledge
or conduct other experiments.</p>
<p>However, the memories and especially the vivid images I’ve acquired
are immensely plentiful. When pieced together, these memories become
invaluable, though they also encompass many secrets I still can’t
unravel to this day.</p>
<p>Having just returned from the alien planet, I vividly remembered
numerous physical formulas and mathematical equations, which I
diligently noted in a workbook. Unfortunately, my brother tore it to
pieces, leaving only fragments. When I inquired about the rest, he
ignored me. The remnants eventually disappeared as well.</p>
<p>Now, 37 years have passed. The scientific theories from the aliens
remain partially in my memory through verbal descriptions and a few
pivotal physical equations, such as a grand unification equation that
integrates the four fundamental forces, the general momentum equation,
and equations defining mass and electric charge, among others. Sadly,
much of it has been forgotten.</p>
<p>After sharing my experience with extraterrestrials online, it
attracted considerable attention. Shanghai Baoshan Television Station
even interviewed me, but the segment was censored and never aired on TV,
although traces of it linger on the internet.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, I’ve been chronicling my encounters with
aliens online, eager to narrate my journey to their planet. However,
busy with managing a small business, my online presence was limited to
brief descriptions of my extraterrestrial adventures.</p>
<p>Authorities warned me via phone calls and direct messages to frame my
extraterrestrial travels as fiction, not factual reports, to avoid
public panic.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I authored “An Adventure to Guoker Planet” as a
novel. Yet, due to censorship, it underwent such extensive revisions
that its essence was lost before it barely made it online, and now, it’s
nearly entirely erased from the internet.</p>
<p>The current climate is increasingly unwelcoming of such disclosures,
tightening controls over the years. I’ve faced multiple summons and
inquiries by the police for spreading this information.</p>
<p>At one point, they demanded I pledge not to post these articles
online anymore. I complied, though the details are fuzzy now; they
likely have the written pledge.</p>
<p>Police searches at my home and scrutiny of my phone instilled fear in
my family, reducing my mother-in-law to tears and sparking frequent,
heated disputes with my wife, who condemned my online postings.</p>
<p>The unilateral flow of information has hardened some netizens against
accepting my accounts, leading to extreme aversion and continuous
reports against me.</p>
<p>Persistent reporting over the years by some has led to my
blacklisting on numerous platforms, notably resulting in the deletion of
my groundbreaking articles on alien physics from my Sina Blog, an
irreplaceable loss due to a lack of backups.</p>
<p>Frequent reports have led to repeated bans on my WeChat account, with
ongoing warnings and restricted functionalities, including frequent
blocks on WeChat Pay. My account on TikTok remains under restrictions
due to the overwhelming number of reports.</p>
<p>The experiences that haunt me the most on that planet are those of
sexual assault, which remain the clearest in my memory. Their practices
of intimacy, by our earthly standards, are profoundly disturbing.
Revealing all these details might be too shocking for our society,
hence, despite my vivid recollections, I’ve opted to share only a select
few incidents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these aliens delved into sensitive topics such as
undercover extraterrestrials on Earth, humanity’s future, prophecies
about Earth, the direction China will take, political figures, and the
emergence of saints.</p>
<p>I am waiting for a time when society acknowledges me, granting me
fame and status that would allow me to disclose these sensitive matters
fully. If I were to write now, my inability to protect myself and my
family would put me and my family at a huge disadvantage. So, I still
don’t write about it.</p>
<p>Given the incomprehensibility of many occurrences during my journey
and the fuzziness of my memories, I’ve found some aspects challenging to
articulate clearly. I hope readers can appreciate this.</p>
<p>I also wish for readers to approach my story with openness and
tolerance, refraining from undue criticism, insults, or reports.</p>
<p>Consider this: With billions of people around the globe, and China
being the most populous, isn’t it plausible that some individuals have
encountered bizarre occurrences?</p>
<p>This book unveils a plethora of previously unknown details about
extraterrestrial life, quenching the public’s thirst for genuine
insights into alien worlds and their inhabitants’ everyday lives. It
also serves as a source of inspiration and reference for researchers and
scientists.</p>
<p>After reading this book, readers will gain a basic understanding of
the advanced technologies, societal structures, ethics, and the physical
composition, both internal and external, of extraterrestrial beings from
highly developed planets.</p>
<p>Online research shows that only a handful of people worldwide claim
to have visited alien planets. Their accounts of extraterrestrial
encounters vary significantly from my own. It’s possible that some of
these individuals are not truthful, while others may have had their
memories severely altered or misled by aliens, or they simply
encountered different species of extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>After returning from an alien planet, I was profoundly shaken,
realizing that alien technologies could radically transform our Earth. I
zealously spread the word, writing thousands of letters to various
authorities over decades, receiving only a few responses, most of which
coldly stated, “This matter does not concern us.”</p>
<p>I even reached out to television stations, only to be mocked by a
person at The "First Time" column of Anhui Radio and Television
Station’s Economic Life Channel who scoffed, "You expect us to interview
you? Who do you think you are?"</p>
<p>My relentless letter-writing deformed my right middle finger, during
which time I also patented a new type of pen.</p>
<p>I personally presented my findings to various organizations, but they
dismissed my materials and explanations outright.</p>
<p>Some suggested that the idea of a farmer encountering aliens was too
absurd for these officials to entertain.</p>
<p>However, often I was turned away before I could even mention aliens,
possibly prejudged by my appearance.</p>
<p>With the advent of the internet in my village, I shifted my efforts
online, spending nearly four decades researching and promoting alien
technology.</p>
<p>Regrettably, even in this age of digital connectivity, I have yet to
garner societal recognition or concern—a confusion shared by many online
and myself.</p>
<p>My strategy now is to continue publishing articles and writing
science fiction online, aiming for fame. Once recognized, the
groundbreaking alien technology of Artificial Field Scanning I’ve
introduced will inevitably gain the attention it deserves, despite any
discontent it may cause.</p>
<p>This approach might be my only route to success. While many online
friends have advised conducting experiments—which I certainly won’t
abandon—my partnership with netizens on these projects has a slim chance
of success due to our basic facilities and resources.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1---abduction-from-home">Chapter 1 - Abduction from
Home</h2>
<p>In the early summer of 1985, when I was 19, the weather was mild and
my bed was yet to be fitted with a mosquito net. I slept alone in the
second room from the west in the front row of my family home, while my
parents occupied the room immediately to its west.</p>
<p>Our home comprised five rooms constructed from clay walls, with the
entrance centrally located. Each side of the entrance featured rooms
with windows, except for the two adjacent to it, which lacked windows. I
occupied the westernmost room, which, notably, had no separation from
the central hallway.</p>
<p>Remarkably, a vivid dream once corrected my memory, revealing the
kitchen was to the north of my room, and that my previous descriptions
of the house being built of bricks and stones were inaccurate; it was,
in fact, a structure of five clay-walled rooms.</p>
<p>The manner in which I was taken by extraterrestrials involved passing
directly through the clay walls, an experience so distinct that the
earthy scent left a lasting impression, challenging the possibility of
stone walls producing such an aroma. This suggests the existing six-room
structure, now of stone and brick, was renovated after 1985 with an
additional room added to the east.</p>
<p>My makeshift bed, situated against the southern wall of my room, was
simply wooden planks, with newspapers plastered at the junction to
prevent clay from the wall from soiling the bed.</p>
<p>The kitchen lay to the north, its stove facing west, and a large
water jar positioned to the east of the stove, near a small window.</p>
<p>Lying in bed, with my head to the east and feet towards the west, I
was approximately 1.5 meters (5 feet) from my parents’ room. It was
through this clay wall, not the main gate, that the extraterrestrials
and I passed, leaving a memorable scent of earth behind.</p>
<p>The floor throughout was earthen, not paved with concrete, and the
door to my parents’ room was nearby.</p>
<p>Shortly after lying down, I drifted into a semi-conscious state and
sensed something circling above our roof, reigniting a familiar
childhood intuition of “they are coming.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the room was bathed in a reddish glow. Startled awake, I
stood by my bed to see the walls seeping a glowing liquid that mixed
dark red with hints of bluish-green. This liquid slowly formed into
humanoid shapes.</p>
<p>These figures appeared composed of numerous, swirling red particles,
buzzing and moving frenetically.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by fear, I trembled uncontrollably, feeling my limbs and
throat stiffen, unresponsive to my mind’s commands.</p>
<p>Though these mysterious figures remained silent, a clear, male voice
seemed to echo in my mind, saying, “Come out with us.”</p>
<p>I was acutely aware that this was not a dream; my mind was fully
awake and the memory vivid.</p>
<p>As I stood frozen, I suddenly felt an unseen force slam into me,
taking control, particularly over my head, which felt as if it were
filled with liquid and fine sand, rendering me numb and full.</p>
<p>This enigmatic force seemed to blur my consciousness, slowing my
thoughts and impairments, and dulling my senses. My body felt eerily
light and unstable as I moved. Gradually, my trembling ceased, and the
fear subsided.</p>
<p>I watched as they passed effortlessly through the wall, which
appeared to become semi-transparent. Following them, I too passed
through the wall. Only outside did I realize my state of undress,
wearing just a sweatshirt and underwear, leaving me utterly
disheveled.</p>
<p>The earthy scent of the wall left a profound impression on me as I
passed through it. Rather than creating an opening, it felt as though
every molecule of the wall dispersed evenly through my body, a sensation
unlike any other. It was as if countless fine grains of sand were gently
rubbing inside me, accompanied by a peculiar sense of refreshment. The
process wasn’t swift; it moved at the pace of a casual stroll.</p>
<p>Over the following decades, I frequently dreamt of passing through
walls. Sometimes I succeeded, and other times I failed. Whenever I
didn’t make it through, I would remind myself to face the wall without
fear or hesitation. There’s no need to force it—just walk through
calmly, with a clear mind.</p>
<p>Upon nearly exiting the wall, my heel would ache numbly, a sensation
that vanished the moment I completed the passage.</p>
<p>Outside, I encountered two individuals, one of whom shone a device on
the wall, possibly making it semi-transparent.</p>
<p>These beings, capable of transitioning between liquid and solid
states, vibrated subtly. Their appearance conveyed a fleeting, surreal
quality, leading me to speculate they were not human but perhaps
robots—the speculation that was later validated.</p>
<p>As I emerged through the wall, the night seemed illuminated by some
source of light, revealing another person who appeared as tangible as
any real person—reminiscent of a little girl from kindergarten.</p>
<p>Approaching her seemed to instill fear; she instinctively stepped
back, maintaining a certain distance from me.</p>
<p>Her facial expression was captivating, standing just about a meter
tall, with a delicate yet full figure. Her eyes and eyelids were notably
large, radiating a bright shine. Her head wasn’t particularly large, and
her eyebrows were arched in a way that added a touch of exotic beauty.
Her chin, nose, and mouth were all small, with her upper lip slightly
curling upwards in an ‘M’ shape. Her waist was incredibly slender,
almost as thin as my arm, which seemed disproportionate to her body. Her
hair, black with hints of blue-green, resembled shiny black rubber
tubes, spiraled and fanning outward.</p>
<p>Her skin was exceptionally smooth, a soft pink-white shade with a
slight blue-green tint, possibly a trick of the light, as this hue
wasn’t always noticeable. Her complexion was finely matte, not
glossy.</p>
<p>Overall, she presented a strikingly beautiful and sensual figure,
with her limbs and torso perfectly rounded, reminiscent of a modern
inflatable doll, suggesting a compact, athletic build.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/zh3DZxlcL2rneM9.jpg" width="336" height="448"></p>
<p>Who are these mysterious people? What they’re up for in my house at
night? My brain was packed with fear and questions.</p>
<p>Then I saw a strong streak of weird-looking white light sweeping down
from the sky, like silver powder snowing heavily on the ground. The
light looked dense, and it stretched out and retracted back section
after section. All the objects it shined on looked clear, and the edge
of the light was sharp. It’s not like normally we see a bright light
shining on something and it reflects everywhere around. For example, a
flashlight generates a light circle where objects inside are clear and
objects outside are not, and there is a light cone in the air. The dense
alien light however creates no light cone, and when it lights up the
tree, all the branches are clear to see. This is similar to some UFO
sightings when it was called the cold light.</p>
<p>Later I learned that the aliens emit low-power artificial fields
along with the light, so that the artificial field scanning can
manipulate space to bend and cut the light into sections. The low-power
artificial field also stimulates the dust in the air into an excited
state to prevent it from interacting with the light. That is why it
creates no light cone in the air. However the low-power artificial field
does not stimulate the ground and trees into an excited state, so
reflection is normal on those objects.</p>
<p>I looked up along the tree to see where the light came from. I saw a
huge thing like two stow hats binding together, dark in color, hovering
silently in the sky, about dozens of meters (roughly 100-200 feet) above
the ground, not far from my house. I couldn’t see what was on the bottom
of it, but its shape was very clear. The light came from the bottom of
this thing, and it seemed to have a row of small dim lamps in different
colors.</p>
<p>A flying saucer! I was shouting in my mind. Because I have read
magazines such as " The Journal of UFO Research"<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>,
and this thing is the typical flying saucer appearance introduced in the
magazine. Ah, I told myself, these mysterious people must be
extraterrestrials! What should I do? Should I run? Should I call for
help?</p>
<p>Before I had time to think, I felt my body become lighter, and then
suddenly recovered again. I got my attention back and looked around.
That wasn’t outside my house. It was all different. I found myself
standing in a cylindrical, extremely fine-built room. The room seemed to
be made of metal, and the walls were seamless without any gaps and
fasteners.</p>
<p>There was gentle light in the room, but I didn’t find any light
bulbs. The light seemed to be coming from the wall very evenly. The
walls were shiny like metal and finely built, with not much furniture
and decorations around. All the stuff in the room was simple and
straightforward.</p>
<p>The room, or I shall say the interior of the UFO, had no doors and
windows. There was a big pillar in the center from floor to ceiling,
about 3 meters (10 feet) thick and 5-6 meters (16-20 feet) tall. A ring
of steps were below the pillar; its height and width were about 40
centimeters (16 inches). The room was about a donut shape where people
lived; its diameter was about dozens of meters (roughly over 100
feet).</p>
<p>Although my memory wasn’t clear about this, I felt I was sucked into
the UFO from the center of the bottom, just like the other mysterious
people.</p>
<p>There was a 3D hologram near the curved metal wall hovering about
70-80 centimeters (roughly 2.5 feet) above the ground. The hologram
played like a movie; its shape could expand and shrink. If not the
hologram had a clear edge just like being cut by a knife, you would
think that there must be something real out there.</p>
<p>I didn’t see any flight instruments, not a single object that looked
close to gauges, nor any switchboards which were common on our
human-made spaceships and aircraft. I saw online that people who had
alien contact and entered UFOs often claim the UFOs they saw have lots
of gauges on instrument panels. What I saw was very different, and I am
very sure about that. Later I knew that they had all the instruments
embedded in the 3D hologram, and all the controls to the spaceship were
done by that same 3D hologram.</p>
<p>I saw 4 people with no facial expressions and made of countless
buzzing red insects. I reckon they were robots. Two of them walked right
in front of me and took off my underwear. After that, I was always naked
until I was sent back home.</p>
<p>I looked down and saw some white cloud around my waist, which made me
less embarrassed. I touched my groin and it proved that I was still
naked. These mysterious people were indeed extraterrestrials, I guessed.
And this round room must be the flying saucer I saw in the sky next to
my house. This spaceship, though not looking big from the outside, was
quite spacious from the inside. So they invited me or maybe abducted me.
I’m afraid I won’t be back home ever again. I felt anxious when I
thought about this.</p>
<p>Soon, the four robots walked inside, and three real aliens with
facial expressions showed up. It was obvious that one of them was female
and the other two were male. The female looked exactly the same as the
girl who showed up next to my house. I thought they were the same
person. Because I was naked and there was a girl right there, I panicked
and looked down. I felt relieved to see that a white cloud was still
covering my waist.</p>
<p>It was bright in the spaceship, so I could see her more clearly. She
was in a tight jumpsuit when her body was like merged with her clothes
together. I felt like she didn’t have bones. She was very meaty and
streamlined, like a dolphin. From the back, her hips looked wide, and
from the front, she had a bulge on her groin and I had no idea what that
was. Her legs were about 8-9 centimeters (roughly 3.5 inches) apart from
each other, not like Earth women have legs stick together closely while
they’re standing.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell the difference in the height of these three aliens.
They all wore tight jumpsuits and stood in a row. One of the males had a
similar face to the female. He also had big eyes, big eyelids, a small
mouth, a small nose, a small chin, big and thin ears, and smooth and
fine pink-white skin, but he looked more male-like, not as meaty blow-up
doll sort of kind like the female alien. He didn’t have the bulge
between his legs like the female, and his hips were not wide. His hair
was like a shiny black rubber pad sticking onto the top of his head.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/noga5dAWcrKxPGw.png" width="332" height="443"></p>
<p>In contrast to humans, these beings were short and slender,
reminiscent of kindergarten-aged children or figures from animated
cartoons.</p>
<p>Their appearance was exquisitely delicate, akin to intricately
crafted dolls or rubber figures, with their facial features gently
contoured and their skin flawlessly smooth and uniformly colored, devoid
of any imperfections or markings.</p>
<p>The man came towards me, pressing his right hand against his chest,
perhaps as their version of a greeting, akin to our handshake on Earth,
and uttered a sentence. His voice was soft, his speech not articulated
clearly in individual words or phrases but rather muffled, similar to a
dreamy mumble or a baby’s babble, as if he needed to breathe to speak.
Nonetheless, his voice was gentle and youthful, like that of a
child.</p>
<p>I later understood that their bodies could instantly internalize
blood oxygen from the outside, negating the need for pulmonary
oxygenation, which led to the degeneration of their vocal and
respiratory functions. However, they were able to communicate unhindered
through their artificial field scanning and frequency interception
technology, which I will clarify further on.</p>
<p>Using their lungs to speak was merely a formality for greeting. It
was just to signify the beginning of a conversation, with the rest of
the communication being handled by their artificial field scanning and
frequency interception system. Essentially, they outsourced their
speaking and breathing functions.</p>
<p>Although I couldn’t comprehend their language, a clear male voice
immediately came through to my ears, the specifics of which I have now
forgotten, but I remember it went something like, “My name is Norton (or
similar). I’m a biologist, responsible for this trip... We are all
terrestrial beings, welcome to visit the Guoker Planet...”</p>
<p>They frequently referred to their planet as Guoker, though the
pronunciation seemed to vary, sometimes sounding like Guokar or Gooker.
When I inquired about the name and location of their planet in the
universe, they declined to tell me.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, “It was you who brought me here against my will;
I never asked to visit your spaceship.” But I kept my thoughts to
myself, simply responding with a noncommittal “hmm.”</p>
<p>After biologist Norton finished speaking and stepped back, another
male, who looked similar but carried a more relaxed and slightly amused
expression, stepped forward. He placed his right hand on his chest and
introduced himself in a clear male voice that immediately filled my
ears, “My name is Suldair,” though I would later hear him called various
names, indicating a significant variance in pronunciation. “I’m a
physicist. Welcome to our planet for a tour.”</p>
<p>Then, a female took a step forward, mimicked the gesture by placing
her right hand on her chest, and spoke. A sweet, gentle female voice
followed: “My name is Willie. Welcome to our planet for a tour.” I would
often hear them elongate the “Li” in her name when they referred to
her.</p>
<p>Her voice was soft and childlike, distinctly feminine, allowing for
an evident distinction between male and female voices. I noticed that
the differences between the voices of their females were minimal; they
almost all sounded the same, making it difficult to distinguish them by
voice alone. The males exhibited more variety in their voices, though
not as much as humans on Earth.</p>
<p>This seemed to be their way of welcoming me, making me think they
were a highly civilized alien race, unlikely to harm or brutally dissect
me, which somewhat eased my nerves.</p>
<p>Biologist Norton made a gesture, and a three-dimensional hologram
appeared next to him. He pointed at it and continued speaking. Although
I couldn’t understand his words, it felt as if a translator was
converting his speech into a clear voice in my ears, sometimes feeling
more like a direct transmission of thought: “You have been a subject of
our long-term observation. Since you were a child, you’ve been brought
aboard our ship multiple times. Your name is Zhang Xiangqian, isn’t it?
According to your customs, people should call you Brother Qian,
right?”</p>
<p>"Some have called me that, but most call me Ah’ Qian," I thought,
puzzled about how they knew my name. Suddenly, I wondered: could they
have learned it from my school teacher?</p>
<p>"Ah’ Qian? We’ll continue to call you Brother Qian. We invited you
here to participate in two very important experiments, hoping to gather
valuable data," they said.</p>
<p>"What kind of experiments?" I asked, curious.</p>
<p>"We wish to study your brain, hoping to find the information we
need," Norton replied.</p>
<p>"Ah! Are you going to cut my brain open?" I blurted out, anxiety
creeping back.</p>
<p>"Ho ho ho!" Physicist Suldair laughed heartily, his laugh
indistinguishable from that of an Earth human, his upper body shaking
with the rhythm of his laughter. "Only you naive Earthlings would do
such a thing," he said.</p>
<p>His laughter made me think, "He acts just like one of us. Could they
merely be dwarfs from somewhere on Earth, disguised in tight,
transparent rubber suits to deceive me, planning to take me somewhere
for their own secretive purposes?"</p>
<p>But what about me could possibly interest them?</p>
<p>However, the thought of Willie’s slender waist made me wonder. How
could any human have such a thin waist? How could any human create
three-dimensional holograms? My despair returned. In truth, I was
terrified of actually leaving Earth, fearing I might never return home,
never see my family again, clinging to the slim hope that I was still on
Earth.</p>
<p>"No, you won’t be harmed," Norton assured me, "We will use our
artificial field scanning technology to study your brain. This field, an
intangible substance of the universe, will not affect your brain in any
way, no matter how deep it penetrates."</p>
<p>With so many people on Earth, I wondered, "Is there something special
about my brain? Why choose me?" Although I kept these questions to
myself, it seemed Norton could read my thoughts.</p>
<p>"As a child, while herding geese in the field, you encountered a
species with an advanced civilization, far more developed in culture and
technology than us. If civilizations were measured in time, ours would
be tens of thousands of years old, Earth’s would be in the thousands,
and these advanced beings would be in the millions, even billions. Their
level of civilization and technological advancement is almost
unimaginable to us. They might not be wary of technologically backward
Earthlings like you, but they are cautious of us, making it difficult
for us to approach and understand them directly."</p>
<p>"In the cosmos, there are species with particularly advanced
civilizations, and it’s possible that the consciousness of one of these
individuals has infiltrated your brain. You now possess part of the
memories of one such highly advanced alien. We intend to scan and record
these memories. We are very curious about their perspectives on the
universe, especially those that differ from ours. Of course, this is
just our hope, and we might not get anything, but I hope we can obtain
what we’re looking for."</p>
<p>I immediately recalled an experience from when I was about seven or
eight years old, alone, herding geese on a sandy patch.</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do?" I asked Norton.</p>
<p>"We’ll use artificial field scanning technology to scan your brain in
a remote, non-contact manner. All you need to do is listen to us, comply
with our arrangements, and cooperate with our experiment. There’s
nothing you need to do," Norton said.</p>
<p>"We’ll take you to visit many places on our planet. You’ll have many
wonderful experiences, and gain knowledge not found on your planet,
enriching your life. When you return to your planet, these experiences
will change your fate. You’ll become a celebrity, a wealthy individual
on your planet.</p>
<p>You’ll be a key figure in changing the destiny of your planet, and in
the future, many will admire you... until the day your planet’s people
disappear from the universe, countless individuals will remember your
name. Because on your Earth, you will be the first person to know the
secret of time.</p>
<p>In the universe, there are many highly developed civilizations. The
first person on any planet who understands the essence of time is
considered the true king among scientists, worshipped as a deity until
the day their civilization disappears from their planet.</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Because the essence of time is the universe’s
most central secret. Deciphering the essence of time is of unparalleled
importance, capable of causing drastic changes on an entire planet,
unmatched by any scientific discovery...</p>
<p>We will soon tell you the essence of time. Although you’re only
receiving this secret from us, not through your own independent
thinking, it doesn’t prevent you from unquestionably becoming the first
person on Earth to truly know the secret of time. The people of your
Earth may not care how you came to know this secret, and in the future,
you might just be considered a god-like existence by chance."</p>
<p>The biologist told me how I would prosper in the future, but I
couldn’t be happy about it. At that time, my only dream was to marry a
beautiful, gentle woman with a delicate figure, and build a large house
with a big courtyard in my hometown. As for the secrets of the universe,
the fate of nations, and the people of Earth, those matters were
completely unrelated to me. I had never thought about them.</p>
<p>Hearing about the brain scan, I became nervous again. They seemed to
immediately guess my concerns.</p>
<p>"There won’t be any problems. Our technology is absolutely safe!"
Suldair approached me, his expression slightly mysterious, and said,
"During your short trip to our planet, we’ll also arrange a beautiful
girlfriend for you!"</p>
<p>The physicist spoke, glancing briefly at Willie, who tossed her head
in a seemingly proud and disdainful manner.</p>
<p>"This time, we’ve invited you for another experiment," Norton
continued.</p>
<p>"We’re going to ask you to perform various sexual experiments with
different women on our planet, and at the same time record your brain
awareness, sensations, movement, and physical information from other
parts of your body.</p>
<p>We will translate this information into numbers, which are of great
importance to us and a source of great wealth for us. When sexual
activity is translated into numbers, it can be used as an exchangeable
commodity, which you earthlings may not understand.</p>
<p>When you were a child, we took you to our spaceship many times, but
we did not arrange for you to come to our planet because at that time,
your body was not yet mature and your sexual consciousness was not
formed. At your current age, you are at your most physically and
sexually powerful stage."</p>
<p>"The planet we are on is more than one, it is technically a star
system, there are many planets around the main planet, just like the
solar system your Earth is in, there are many planets and moons,"
Suldair interjected.</p>
<p>"Our people live on dozens of planets in the vicinity of our main
planet, and on different planets, there are many different kinds of
women, with a wide variety of external body shapes, the strangeness of
which you may not be able to imagine, but which you will encounter later
on.</p>
<p>Of course, we will try our best to select some people who are close
to the size of your women on Earth to have sex with you. If the external
shape of the body is so different, I suspect that you will not be
sexually aroused by their bodies.</p>
<p>For example, a male on your Earth might be sexually aroused by a sow
or a cow, because the body of the sow or cow is more or less similar to
that of your Earthling, and has some similar sexual organs, whereas if
you were dealing with a prawn or an insect, you wouldn’t be sexually
aroused at all."</p>
<p>Sudair’s words made me a little worried, is it forcing me to have sex
with those sows, cows, and other animals, and such a beautiful girl like
Weili to have sex, that would be so cool ah! Maybe these guys are just
perverts, they won’t be able to do what I want easily.</p>
<p>At this time, the two people whose bodies were slightly shaking,
probably robots, came to me, one with a three-dimensional virtual
picture of my house above his hand, and the other with a
three-dimensional picture of a bottle with a corpse of an earthling in
it.</p>
<p>One of the robots said to me, "From now until the end, if you listen
well, stay quiet, and fully comply with our arrangements, we will return
you home unharmed." After saying this, the robot showed me a
three-dimensional hologram of my house.</p>
<p>Another robot spoke, "If you disobey, resist, or fail to follow our
arrangements, this will be your fate."</p>
<p>This robot then showed me a hologram of a human body being preserved
in a bottle of liquid, which sent chills down my spine and made my heart
race, instantly making me anxious again. Any good impression I had of
them collapsed in an instant; they might be malevolent, and my chances
might be slim.</p>
<p>I was extremely uneasy and overwhelmed with fear for a while, but
then tried to comfort myself. They captured me for two experiments: to
scan my brain without physical contact, which shouldn’t harm me,
right?</p>
<p>They wanted sexual data, meaning I was to engage in sexual activities
with different types of women from their planet. It couldn’t be that
bad, could it? Besides, I’m currently single and lacking sexual
experience, quite eager actually.</p>
<p>"Where in the universe is your planet located? Is it in the Milky
Way? How far is it from Earth?"</p>
<p>"We don’t usually answer such questions," was their response.</p>
<p>"How long will I stay on your planet?"</p>
<p>"By Earth’s measure of time, about a month."</p>
<p>"That’s a long time. My family will worry."</p>
<p>"No, they won’t. The way time passes for us is different. The time
you spend touring our planet plus the journey here and back won’t exceed
a single Earth night. We’ll return you before dawn, and no one,
including your family, will realize you’ve been to our planet."</p>
<p>I was skeptical of Norton’s words, "Do you have such capabilities?
Can you reverse time?"</p>
<p>"We can’t reverse time. Reversing time would mean changing the speed
at which time passes, and it seems like changing the speed could achieve
the effect of reversing time.</p>
<p>However, the speed of time is a relative concept. In different parts
of the universe, on different planets, time may pass at different
speeds. It only makes sense to compare the passage of time in two
different places; talking about the speed of time passing in the same
place is meaningless. For example, the concept of size only makes sense
when comparing different objects; comparing the size of the same object
is meaningless.</p>
<p>“We use artificial field scanning technology to irradiate a specific
area of space, filling it with an energy field to change the speed at
which time passes. This technology can make time in one area pass slower
than in another. This concept is known on our planet as the potential
difference of time.</p>
<p>Conversely, we can make time in one area pass faster than in another.
The concept of time moving faster or slower doesn’t apply to the same
location; reversing time is impossible because it would require events
to happen backward at the same spatial location and point. As I said,
comparing the passage of time at the same location is meaningless."</p>
<p>Norton explained patiently, but my mind was numb, and I couldn’t
understand.</p>
<p>"We can now create some phenomena of time reversal in a localized
spatial area, but we can only make a certain event rapidly revert to its
previous state and start over. We can’t achieve complete, pure,
step-by-step phenomena of time reversal," added the physicist Suldair,
which only confused me more.</p>
<p>"Any other questions?" Norton asked, looking into my eyes, as my ears
caught his words.</p>
<p>"If there are no more questions, we’ll now begin our journey
back."</p>
<p>Norton waved his hand in the air, and suddenly, a white, delicate,
square-shaped mist appeared. This mist then formed a three-dimensional
hologram flashing with text I didn’t recognize, as Norton operated it
with his fingers.</p>
<p>A clear, standard, sweet female voice came through my ears,
continuously speaking. Suddenly, I felt lighter, guessing we were
already on our way to their planet.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2---a-conversation-about-the-flying-saucer-during-our-ride">Chapter
2 - A Conversation about the Flying Saucer During Our Ride</h2>
<p>Whenever my body starts to feel lighter, I always hear a soft, sweet,
and clingy female voice in my ears, talking non-stop from an unknown
source. On the three-dimensional virtual screen, I saw a planet appear
and then rapidly vanish.</p>
<p>After they started the spaceship, there was nothing else for them to
do, so they let the robots operate the spaceship by watching the
three-dimensional virtual screen, and we began to chat.</p>
<p>I was curious about this spaceship, which piqued my interest in the
UFO we were aboard.</p>
<p>"This spaceship we’re on is what people on Earth often refer to as a
UFO, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>
<p>"UFOs fly very fast, right? I read in a magazine that at their
fastest, they can fly at the speed of light, which is 300,000 kilometers
per second. Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Yes, UFOs can travel at the speed of light," Suldair said, "UFOs
have three spacetime states. The first is a massless excited state,
where the UFO has a zero rest mass, a definite moving mass, and always
moves at the speed of light. This state is actually the same as the
spacetime state of light emitted naturally. The second is a
quasi-excited state with minimal mass, where the UFO’s mass is only
about one ten-thousandth of a gram by your Earth’s standards. It can
hover in the air above your Earth’s surface and can instantly switch to
a massless excited state. The third is the normal state, where the mass
transformation system inside is turned off, and it has a definite mass
like ordinary objects."</p>
<p>"How incredible your UFOs are! What’s the principle of their flight?
It must be complex and profound, right?"</p>
<p>"The principle of UFO flight is actually quite simple, and it can be
summed up in just one sentence in your language," Suldair said. "In the
universe, if you reduce the mass of any object to zero, the instant it
becomes massless, it will suddenly move at the speed of light. That’s
the principle of faster-than-light UFO travel."</p>
<p>The principle of UFO flight is this simple? This was far beyond my
expectations. But how can we make an object’s mass become zero? I think
that’s the real challenge.</p>
<p>"There are two fundamentally different modes of motion in nature:
quantitative change and qualitative change. Ordinary motion is a matter
of quantitative change, well described by your Earth’s scientists,
Newton and Galileo.</p>
<p>“The principles of motion for airplanes and cars that you Earthlings
have mastered involve momentum, which is mass times velocity, and force,
which is the change in momentum over time. Your airplanes can only fly
within the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>“However, the momentum of our UFOs is calculated as the vector speed
of light minus the UFO’s velocity, multiplied by the UFO’s mass<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>“Taking the derivative of this momentum with respect to time<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> four kinds of forces appear<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. These are the four most basic
forces in the universe. The force on an object is also the degree to
which the object’s momentum changes with time.</p>
<p>“The mass of the flying saucer is changing with time<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.
When the mass of the flying saucer first begins to decrease, its speed
remains unchanged. When the mass of the flying saucer decreases to zero,
its speed suddenly changes to the speed of light.</p>
<p>“The change in velocity is sudden; it can go from zero to the speed
of light instantly. There are only two speeds involved: the initial
velocity and the speed of light. The change in velocity isn’t
continuous," Norton explained.</p>
<p>"Our UFOs operate on a different principle of motion—qualitative
change, meaning the mass of the UFO can change over time. When the mass
of the UFO changes from a certain amount to zero, it doesn’t need any
additional force to accelerate; it will continue to move at the speed of
light by inertia, unless something internally or externally changes this
state of motion.</p>
<p>"In the universe, any object at rest relative to us is surrounded by
space that moves outward at the speed of light. This movement is the
fundamental reason objects have mass, with mass being a measure of the
quantity of space displacement (within 4π solid angle) occurring at
light speed around the object.</p>
<p>"If you find a way to make the light-speed movement around an object
disappear, then that object becomes massless. A massless object doesn’t
need any additional force to move at the speed of light relative to
us."</p>
<p>"The reason behind this is that all objects in the universe have a
rest momentum - mass multiplied by the vector speed of light<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, and the rest momentum is
conserved.</p>
<p>"When the velocity part of the rest momentum is zero<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>,
the mass part becomes infinite. We dislike the infinity. If the infinity
that we dislike does not appear, there is another possibility - the rest
mass is zero.</p>
<p>"You Earthlings recognize the rest energy in the theory of
relativity, but you do not realize that the source of rest energy is
rest momentum.”</p>
<p>I seemed to understand a bit and asked, "So, your UFOs can travel at
the speed of light. In the books on Earth, it’s said that the distance
between most stars and us is measured in light-years, which means
traveling at the speed of light would still take years. How do you say
it only takes a few hours to reach your planet? Are you very close to
us, always hiding nearby?"</p>
<p>"When an object moves at the speed of light, the length of space in
its direction of movement shrinks to zero," Norton’s words surprised
me.</p>
<p>Suldair added, "It’s like what people on Earth say, ‘Far in the sky,
yet close before your eyes<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.’"</p>
<p>"When the spatial length in the direction of motion is zero, wouldn’t
your flying saucers not require any time to travel at the speed of
light? Then why do you say it takes several hours for your flying
saucers to return to your planet?"</p>
<p>"For instance, a flying saucer with a mass of 450 tons (the exact
number is forgotten) needs time for the process of its mass decreasing
from 450 tons to zero at takeoff, which is called transitioning the
spacetime state. Similarly, the process of its mass returning from zero
to 450 tons upon landing also requires time.</p>
<p>In fact, when the flying saucer is on our planet, it first uses
external electrical or field energy to reduce its mass to a very minute
amount, such as 0.450 grams, reaching a near-excited state. At takeoff,
the flying saucer uses its own energy to reduce its mass from 0.450
grams to zero. Once its mass reaches zero, it enters an excited state
and starts moving at the speed of light without needing any additional
force applied.</p>
<p>When the flying saucer arrives at your planet, its mass is not
changed back to 450 tons but to a very small amount, to save energy.
This is because changing the mass of the flying saucer and transitioning
to the spacetime state requires a significant amount of energy, and the
flying saucer itself cannot carry too much energy.</p>
<p>The energy equation of the flying saucer is its mass multiplied by
the square of the speed of light. From this equation, it’s evident that
changing the mass of the flying saucer requires a tremendous amount of
energy," Norton explained.</p>
<p>"When there’s a thin gas in front of the spacecraft, we can use the
field generated by the flying saucer to transition the spacetime state
of the gas, making its mass zero as well, thus preventing any
interaction with our spacecraft. Two objects with zero mass can pass
through each other without any interactive forces.</p>
<p>This way, our spacecraft can pass through without any effect on us.
Or we can use the field generated by the flying saucer to directly push
the gas away. Since the nature of the field is an intangible material
moving in a cylindrical spiral through space, it doesn’t produce sound
when it interacts with air. Both methods allow the flying saucer to fly
through the air without any noise.</p>
<p>However, if we encounter a planet, we cannot reduce the entire
planet’s mass to zero or transition its entire spacetime state due to
the massive amount of energy required.</p>
<p>We can only avoid the planet. Avoiding the planet requires changing
states. If our flying saucer encounters no planets in its path, the only
time required is for its mass to change to zero at takeoff. Upon
reaching a planet, changing the mass from zero back to a small amount
upon landing requires time, while mid-flight does not require time. The
hours spent in flight are mainly for transitioning spacetime states to
avoid planets."</p>
<p>Sudair said, "According to the theory of relativity on your planet,
if we assume our planet is 50 light-years away from Earth, a flying
saucer departing from our planet to yours and immediately returning
would be perceived by people on both our planet and yours as taking 100
years. However, the passengers inside the flying saucer would feel the
round trip only took a few hours."</p>
<p>"Is this true? If it is, then the people on your planet also have to
wait a long time for your return. A trip to Earth wouldn’t be easy," I
said.</p>
<p>"In reality, we also need to consider the difference in the passage
of time between our planet and yours; the rate at which time passes
varies across different planets in the universe.</p>
<p>Of course, all this can be artificially altered. When the flying
saucer takes off, we use an artificial field to place the surrounding
space of the flying saucer into an energy field. This allows us to
artificially change the spacetime around the flying saucer. Departing
from this special energy field is completely different from departing
from our planet. As a result, people on our planet do not have to wait
for 100 years; they might only need to wait a few hours, depending on
the strength of the energy field."</p>
<p>Suldair’s words were beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>"We Earthlings have also observed your flying saucers and noticed
their sudden, intense acceleration. The passengers inside must
experience immense forces. How do you mitigate the forces experienced by
passengers inside the flying saucer? Or are your people’s bodies
special, capable of withstanding forces hundreds to thousands of times
greater than humans can?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Flying saucers travel with zero or minimal mass, so the force on
passengers is acceleration multiplied by mass. If the mass is zero, even
with immense acceleration, the force on passengers remains zero or very
minimal. With zero or nearly zero mass, the collision and friction
forces with other objects are also zero or extremely minimal. This also
explains why flying saucers make no sound when flying through Earth’s
atmosphere," the physicist Suldair explained.</p>
<p>I seemed to grasp some understanding and continued to ask, "How can
one build a flying saucer? Or rather, how is a flying saucer built?"</p>
<p>"You want to return to Earth and build a flying saucer?" Willie
countered, "If you build a flying saucer, you’d just hop on it and run
around everywhere."</p>
<p>"Ha, ha," Suldair laughed, "If Brother Qian accidentally flies it
near Mars and doesn’t know how to return, that would be a big
problem."</p>
<p>"Then Brother Qian might as well live on Mars," Willie said
mockingly, "If he has a girlfriend on Earth, that’d be tragic for them.
They could only miss each other sadly. Isn’t that a common scene in
their movies?"</p>
<p>"I don’t have a girlfriend, and I don’t want to go to Mars." I wanted
to counter their mockery but held back.</p>
<p>Norton said, "How could Brother Qian alone build a flying saucer? If
he grasped the principles of the flying saucer and the people of his
planet believed his theory, Earthlings would crazily invest resources to
develop flying saucers, just like when they developed the atomic bomb.
Only then, it’s possible for Earthlings to build a flying saucer."</p>
<p>"How much would it cost to develop a flying saucer?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It would cost about the same as it did to develop the atomic bomb on
Earth," Norton replied.</p>
<p>"It’s impossible. When Brother Qian returns and tells his Earth
compatriots about the flying saucer, how it works, and how to build one.
Ah, guess what? His Earth compatriots would say, ‘Oh! Where did this
madman, this lunatic come from, spouting nonsense,’" Suldair continued
mockingly.</p>
<p>Suldair’s words were harsh, but this outcome seemed most likely.</p>
<p>"Then your flying saucers must carry a lot of energy. What kind of
energy do you use?"</p>
<p>"Nuclear or neutron energy can be used. Don’t forget, during
long-distance inertial flight, flying saucers don’t need energy. Only at
the start, when taking off and the mass turns to zero to transition to
the spacetime state, does it require a huge amount of energy. When the
flying saucer takes off from our planet, we first use external
electrical energy or field energy to significantly reduce the mass of
the flying saucer to a minimal amount," Norton reminded me.</p>
<p>"Why are your flying saucers shaped like round disks, and in which
direction do they fly? What does the propulsion system of a flying
saucer look like, and how does it work? Can you explain it simply?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Flying saucers are actually quite similar to the accelerators found
on Earth. The round edges of the saucer are an annular cavity containing
a stream of charged particles.</p>
<p>These charged particles are of the same charge and repel each other,
so their density cannot be increased. By making these charged particles
move rapidly in a circle, we can convert the electric field into a
magnetic field, which allows us to increase the density of the
charges.</p>
<p>The door of a small flying saucer is usually located at the bottom.
If it were on the side, it would disrupt the circular flow of charged
particles. Large flying saucers typically carry high-power artificial
field scanning equipment that scans the saucer’s shell, putting it into
an excited state, and allowing personnel to enter and exit directly
through the shell, generally eliminating the need for a door.</p>
<p>When flying at the speed of light, the direction of movement is
perpendicular to the disc surface of the saucer, and it follows a
right-hand screw rule. Imagine holding the saucer with your right hand;
the direction of your four fingers wrapping around matches the direction
of the charged particles moving inside, while your thumb points in the
direction of the saucer’s movement.</p>
<p>If the flying saucer arrives in the airspace above your Earth, in a
quasi-excited state, it can fly at any speed less than the speed of
light and can also be manually piloted. Its flight direction can be in
any direction along the side of the saucer."</p>
<p>"When the flying saucer is above Earth, does it install a
conventional engine like the airplanes on Earth to stir the air for
flight?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No. Our approach is to transition the saucer from a quasi-excited
state to an excited state, allowing it to move at the speed of light.
However, the flight time is set to be extremely short, so after flying a
very small distance, it returns to a quasi-excited state, then
transitions back to an excited state and flies another small distance.
The saucer continually switches between these flight states to fly. This
method of flight is also controlled by computer programs or with
assistance.</p>
<p>Flying in this manner above Earth, from the outside, the saucer can
fly at any speed, exhibiting no inertia, making right-angle turns, and
demonstrating extremely high maneuverability. The flight path appears
very strange to Earthlings," Suldair corrected my understanding.</p>
<p>"What exactly powers the flying saucer? How is it able to move at the
speed of light, or how does its mass become zero?" I was still trying to
clarify the issue.</p>
<p>"The propulsion system of flying saucers fundamentally involves the
transformation between electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Both
uniform linear motion and accelerated motion of a charge can generate a
gravitational field, adhering to two basic principles.</p>
<p>One is that charges in uniform linear motion produce positive and
negative gravitational fields distributed on a curved surface in the
opposite direction of motion.</p>
<p>The other is that the magnetic field generated by accelerating
charges is variable. When the distribution of the magnetic field on the
curved surface changes, it can generate linear gravitational and
electric fields along the edge of the curve. At a certain moment, the
changing magnetic field, the generated electric field, and the
gravitational field are perpendicular to each other.</p>
<p>The gravitational field produced by moving charges is continuously
distributed, while the gravitational field produced by universal
gravitation is symmetrically distributed around a point. The key is how
to transform the continuously distributed gravitational field into a
point-symmetric gravitational field." Suldair provided me with an
answer. Then, Norton told me:</p>
<p>"Your Earth scientist Faraday’s discovery of electromagnetism,
converting electricity into magnetism and vice versa, has led to the
widespread use of electric power on Earth, profoundly impacting your
world.</p>
<p>Faraday stated that changing magnetic fields produces perpendicular
electric fields. In fact, a gravitational field is also produced in
another perpendicular direction. At this time, the changing magnetic
field, electric field, and gravitational field are perpendicular to each
other.</p>
<p>The principle of flying saucer flight utilizes the transformation
between electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Changing
electromagnetic fields can produce positive and negative gravitational
fields, especially the anti-gravitational field that, when applied to an
object, can reduce its mass, even to zero. Once an object’s mass reaches
zero, it enters an excited state and suddenly starts moving at the speed
of light. This is why flying saucers can fly at the speed of light.</p>
<p>On Earth, electricity is widely used, whereas, on our planet, we do
not use electricity but artificial field scanning. The positive and
negative gravitational fields generated by changing electromagnetic
fields, working under computer control, are referred to as artificial
field scanning.</p>
<p>If Earthlings mastered the transformation between electromagnetic and
gravitational fields, not only could they build light-speed flying
saucers, but they could also develop artificial field scanning
technology. Artificial field scanning is not just about making objects’
masses reach zero to move at light speed and creating light-speed flying
saucers; it has many other incredible applications.</p>
<p>These include large-scale cold welding in construction and industrial
manufacturing, treating diseases under computer control, enabling
objects to disappear instantly, establishing a global movement network,
creating solar energy concentrators for cheap, clean energy, and
more.</p>
<p>Artificial field scanning can also create many products that change
time and space, manufacture virtual buildings and holographic human
bodies, process information, read and store human thoughts and
consciousness, and enable people to communicate directly through the
brain over long distances…"</p>
<p>The explanations given by Norton and others were difficult for me to
understand, and I decided not to ask further about flying saucers.</p>
<p>"So, you often pilot flying saucers to explore other planets,
right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we have come to your Earth many times," Norton confirmed my
guess.</p>
<p>"You have also been a subject of our long-term observation."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3---superluminal-communication-technology-on-guoker-planet">Chapter
3 - Superluminal Communication Technology on Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>After a moment of silence, I suddenly remembered to ask, "How do you
pilot your flying saucers?"</p>
<p>"The flying saucers are too fast for humans to pilot. They are
operated by pre-set computer programs," explained Suldair</p>
<p>"The passage of time inside and outside the saucer is different. Not
only do the interior and exterior of the saucer experience time
differently, but the area where the pilot controls are located also has
a different spacetime from other parts of the saucer.</p>
<p>To fly to a specific planet, we need to measure the distance and
coordinates between that planet and ours in advance. We use the travel
time of the saucer to control the distance flown. After setting up the
pilot program, we can then fly there.</p>
<p>"When the saucer arrives at Earth, we bring it to a quasi-excited
state to stop. Then we switch it to an excited state to fly at the speed
of light, but the set time is extremely short, allowing the saucer to
fly only a tiny distance before switching back to the quasi-excited
state.</p>
<p>By continuously changing the spacetime state of the saucer, we can
make it fly over Earth at any speed far below the speed of light."</p>
<p>"Does this measurement need to be very accurate? If it’s wrong, could
the saucer crash?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Definitely. If the measurements are not precise, it’s like how
accidents happen with your airplanes - crashing into a planet and
resulting in destruction and death.</p>
<p>We first use a pre-set computer program to control the saucer to
approach your Earth at the speed of light. When near your Earth, we
change its spacetime state to continue flying toward your planet at a
speed much less than light," said Suldair.</p>
<p>"However, this measurement is not difficult for us. The most advanced
technology on Earth is lasers, while we use fields for measurement. You
Earthlings use lasers, which are considered the most advanced. We
measure with fields, the essence of which is space undergoing
cylindrical spiral motion changes. Measuring with fields is much more
advanced than with lasers."</p>
<p>Measurement involves the transmission of information. On your Earth,
using lasers to measure the position and distance to the Moon requires
the reflection of lasers back to determine. This method has obvious
flaws, especially for distant planets far from your Earth, where lasers
cannot be emitted due to energy dissipation. Additionally, the speed of
laser emission and reflection is limited.</p>
<p>However, using our artificial fields for scanning, energy dissipation
is zero. Not only can we emit to distant planets, but the field can also
move superluminally. The essence of the field is non-physical space,
unaffected by the limitation of objects’ movement speed not exceeding
the speed of light.</p>
<p>Currently, we not only measure the distance and position of distant
planets using fields but also observe these distant planets with fields.
We also use artificial field scanning for mutual communication, which is
far superior to lasers and electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>For instance, on your Earth, people driving cars can communicate with
electromagnetic waves, which generally works fine because the speed of
electromagnetic waves is faster than the speed of cars. However, if we
were flying around in light-speed saucers in space, using light-speed
electromagnetic waves to communicate would be a joke.</p>
<p>Therefore, superluminal artificial field scanning communication is
our ideal and only choice.</p>
<p>"Do you also use artificial field scanning for communication on your
planet?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Of course, on our planet, we all use artificial field scanning for
communication. The advantage of field communication is unmatched by
electromagnetic wave communication," Suldair said.</p>
<p>"For example, if a mining disaster occurs in a deep underground coal
mine on your Earth, and the mine shaft is buried under thick layers of
soil, electromagnetic wave signals from your Earth cannot penetrate the
thick layers of soil and cannot contact the outside world.</p>
<p>But if it were us, using the field as a medium for communication,
since the essence of the field is space, which can traverse the entire
planet, there would be no such obstacle.</p>
<p>For example, when detecting the interior of a planet or predicting
earthquakes, artificial field scanning is very convenient.</p>
<p>Field propagation of information not only has powerful penetrative
ability with almost nothing to block it, but also has minimal energy
dissipation and attenuation during propagation, even reaching zero, and
can propagate to very distant places. Only energy is required during
signal transmission and reception, with no energy consumption during
long-distance transmission.</p>
<p>Another obvious advantage of field propagation of information is that
the speed is faster than electromagnetic waves and can theoretically
reach almost infinite speed.</p>
<p>The speed of electromagnetic wave propagation is the speed of light.
According to the theory of relativity on Earth, the fastest speed in the
universe is the speed of light. However, the speed of information
transmission through space can be faster than the speed of light. How is
this possible?</p>
<p>Space is a special kind of matter, very different from ordinary
physical particles, which possess mass and charge. The speed of ordinary
objects cannot exceed the speed of light because as the speed of
ordinary particles approaches the speed of light, their mass tends
towards infinity.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic waves and light are essentially the accelerated
motion of charged particles, creating a counter-gravity field. This
makes the charged particles, usually electrons, lose their mass and
charge characteristics and enter an excited state, moving at the speed
of light.</p>
<p>Light itself is also a type of particle, whose wave nature is the
wave motion of space itself. Since space is always moving at the speed
of light, light is actually stationary in space, moving along with the
space at the speed of light. Its speed cannot exceed the speed of light.
Any material particle, in its natural state, cannot move faster than the
speed of light.</p>
<p>However, space, having no mass or charge and being different from
ordinary matter, is not constrained by this limitation.</p>
<p>"Using fields to communicate is a high-level method," Norton says,
"because the universe is composed only of material particles and space.
Communication using material particles to process information is
outdated; using space to transmit information is the most advanced."</p>
<p>"Not only do we use space to transmit information, but on our planet,
we also use space to process information on a large scale," Suldair
says, "Our computers and the global public information network are like
the computers on Earth and the internet that is about to be born. Our
computers are virtual, and the public information network relies mainly
on space for information transmission.</p>
<p>With our artificial field scanning technology, we can connect the
brains of all our people to others and the public information network
continuously through space.</p>
<p>Therefore, we don’t need computers or other devices to communicate
and connect with others or to access the internet.</p>
<p>We also utilize space for storing information in our universe.
There’s a fundamental theorem in our concept of the space information
field about space and information:</p>
<p>Any part of the universe can store all the information from the past,
present, and future of the universe. In other words, the capacity of
space to store information is theoretically infinite.</p>
<p>However, in practical terms, the ability of space to store
information is subject to certain constraints. While not infinite, the
capacity for information storage in space would still appear incredibly
vast to people on Earth.</p>
<p>Currently, humans are mainly aware of the importance and value of
tangible resources like oil, coal, and metals, not yet fully
appreciating the significance and value of data and information.</p>
<p>Eventually, people from Earth will uncover the mysteries hidden
within space and begin to extensively use it for transmitting,
processing, and storing data.</p>
<p>This is particularly true when humans develop spacecraft capable of
traveling at light speed. Relying on traditional light-speed
electromagnetic waves for communication during interstellar journeys
would be ineffective.</p>
<p>Such spacecraft will require a mode of communication that is
instantaneous, with a velocity approaching infinity, leveraging the
movement of space itself, akin to the concept of quantum entanglement in
quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>About an hour later, I noticed the three-dimensional holograms inside
the spaceship suddenly vanish. The few red robots, which were slightly
trembling, quickly shrank into a small size, turned a purplish-red like
liquid droplets, scattered on the ground, and then disappeared into the
ship’s interior.</p>
<p>The mysterious voice returned in my mind (not through my ears),
announcing, "We have arrived at the planet Guoker. It’s time to
descend."</p>
<p>This soft female voice, which had been continuously speaking, seemed
to be guiding or explaining something.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, we had reached their planet. They stood up and
announced, "The journey is over. We’ve reached our planet. Let’s head
down."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4---arriving-at-guoker-planet-spacecraft-hangar">Chapter
4 - Arriving at Guoker Planet Spacecraft Hangar</h2>
<p>I was thrilled, imagining what this planet might look like. I thought
it must be highly advanced in technology, surely bustling with
prosperity. The streets would definitely be crowded, and lively with
people coming and going. People must be dressed in the latest fashions,
perhaps even in bizarre and unusual styles. The buildings must be
beautiful, grand, and imposing, with all sorts of strange cars running
about, maybe even cars flying through the air...</p>
<p>Would there be any major leader to welcome us, or perhaps some sort
of public welcoming event?</p>
<p>We didn’t walk out of the spaceship; rather, it felt like our bodies
floated, and we left the ship, with the scenery changing dramatically
before our eyes.</p>
<p>What appeared before me was not a welcoming party or the bustling
streets of this planet’s cities. I saw many flying saucers of different
sizes on racks.</p>
<p>A few robots approached one flying saucer, likely the one we had just
been in. I guessed this place might be a flying saucer warehouse.</p>
<p>Now, up close, I observed the exterior of the flying saucer we had
been in. It was clearly made of metal, in a lead-gray color, seamless,
with no windows, holes, or visible lights. How could it emit light
outward?</p>
<p>When the flying saucer arrived on Earth, could it hover in the sky,
and did people enter and exit from the bottom? Inside the saucer, there
was a thick pillar, hollow in the middle, connected to the door at the
bottom.</p>
<p>At that moment, the dull feeling in my brain disappeared, and my
thoughts became as clear as they normally are, my spirits lifted.</p>
<p>I looked up carefully at the flying saucer warehouse, which was
immensely huge, stretching beyond what the eye could see, and incredibly
tall, about the height of dozens of buildings. The racks held many
flying saucers, varying greatly in size.</p>
<p>Standing on the ground, I wondered about the materials used for the
walls and roof of such a vast space.</p>
<p>I thought these materials might not exist on Earth, considering the
enormity of the building, which seemed to span tens of kilometers
without a single supporting column, a feat that seemed unbelievable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, standing there, I felt significantly heavier than on
Earth, which was somewhat strenuous. I assumed the gravity on this
planet must be stronger than Earth’s, necessitating roofing materials of
exceptional strength.</p>
<p>Looking up at the roof, I pondered what special materials were used
for such a vast span in their warehouse.</p>
<p>The roof was too high for me to see clearly. I walked over to the
warehouse walls and began to inspect them closely. I found the walls
were soft, delicate yellow, very fine, and flawless.</p>
<p>I wondered, is it necessary for a wall to be this refined? Upon
closer inspection, I found the walls resembled the bodies of the robots
on the spaceship, made up of countless fine, tiny components that
vibrated subtly. This vibration wasn’t uniform but gave off a sense of
disarray.</p>
<p>When I touched the wall, it felt hollow, and my hand seemed to be
stopped by an invisible force. The further I pushed my hand in, the
greater the resistance, similar to the repulsion felt when two magnets
with the same poles are pushed together. However, this repulsive force
felt much stronger than any ordinary magnet could produce.</p>
<p>"Could this wall be made of some kind of intangible material?" I
wondered internally.</p>
<p>"Yes! This is a type of virtual construction generated by an
artificial field, emanating from those tiny black objects at the bottom
of the wall. These black objects are called artificial field generators.
They emit two types of fields. One is a repulsive field that is
symmetrical along a plane, opposite to the gravitational field on your
Earth. It can push everything outward from its central plane.</p>
<p>The middle part of the plane is called a light-condensing field,
which can solidify light from the outside within a certain spatial
range. The yellow light you see is because the light-condensing field
has chosen to solidify yellow light, omitting other colors.</p>
<p>We could also choose to solidify blue, red, green, or any other
colors—it simply depends on the preferences of the designer.</p>
<p>"The light is collected from the surrounding environment. If it’s
nighttime, less light is collected, and you’ll see the walls appear
dimmer."</p>
<p>That mysterious, standard male voice appeared in my mind again (This
time it didn’t seem to come through my ears) and continued to explain to
me. "You’re smart to realize that both the walls and the roof are
virtual, essentially just forms of energy existence. If the artificial
field switch is pressed, the walls and the roof can immediately vanish
without a trace.</p>
<p>If hit by an unexpected impact, these virtual walls and roofs can
withstand the blow, their strength far surpassing that of real walls and
roofs. However, there is still a limit.</p>
<p>Should the speed and force of the impact exceed a certain threshold,
an object can still penetrate and cause damage inside the virtual
building. This also depends on the strength we’ve designed, which,
clearly, is directly proportional to energy.</p>
<p>You might find this strange, but our planet is, in fact, highly
virtualized."</p>
<p>I hadn’t anticipated that upon setting foot on this planet, the first
marvel I’d encounter would be virtual walls.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5--first-experience-of-global-public-information-web">Chapter
5- First Experience of Global Public Information Web</h2>
<p>"Is your planet in the Milky Way? How far is it from Earth?" I
wondered silently.</p>
<p>This time, the standard voice didn’t answer me.</p>
<p>Where does this voice come from? From my family home on Earth to
here, it has always followed me, speaking in my ear. Sometimes it
doesn’t seem like a voice but more like a thought, naturally appearing
in my mind, not something heard with my ears.</p>
<p>Did they install a translator on me? But who’s speaking? Who is
talking to me? Who is informing me?</p>
<p>Or is there another version of me answering my questions? The
standard voice remained silent, still not answering me.</p>
<p>"Who are you? I can’t see you. How can you always follow me?" I asked
in my mind.</p>
<p>"I am Zone Map 300 spacecraft (the name of the spacecraft we were on,
I forgot the exact name) information service, capable of providing you
with two types of voice services remotely. One uses our interception
technology to directly input speech signals into your brain, and the
other transmits sound to your ears."</p>
<p>"Was it you speaking to me in my house?" I wondered silently.</p>
<p>"Yes, at that time, the Zone Map 300 spacecraft was above your house,
providing you with language information services. Although you have now
stepped onto our planet, you are still close to the Zone Map300
spacecraft, and it is still the equipment inside the spacecraft
providing you with language information services.</p>
<p>Our planet has two major networks. One is the Global Public Movement
Web (later as GMW), which allows objects and individuals to move at the
speed of light globally. The other is the Global Public Information Web
(later as GIW), which can provide information services to everyone
globally," the standard voice explained.</p>
<p>"Once you step out of this spacecraft warehouse, the Zone Map 300
spacecraft’s information service intelligent system will no longer
provide information services to you.</p>
<p>The GIW will take over and provide you with information services. The
GIW is powerful. As long as you are on our planet, it can provide you
with at least four types of information services:</p>
<p>one uses interception technology to directly send sound information
to your brain, another uses interception technology to directly send
three-dimensional images to your brain, one uses artificial field
scanning technology to remotely create sounds in your ears, and one uses
artificial field scanning technology to remotely create
three-dimensional images in front of your eyes. All these are delivered
remotely and contact-free."</p>
<p>Later, I learned that their GIW is akin to our current internet. Each
person’s brain can directly connect to the GIW, and they can transmit
information over long distances through space. This way, their people
are always connected to the GIW while on their planet.</p>
<p>Therefore, they don’t need to learn many things in the traditional
sense. Whenever they need to know something, they can directly access
the GIW through their brains, similar to how we search the internet
today, especially for knowledge that requires rote memorization, which
they don’t need to study at all. They have no teachers and no schools
like we do.</p>
<p>For more flexible or creative knowledge, they use what’s called
"interception" technology, which involves scanning and transmitting
information to the brain from the outside, using a non-contact method
with artificial field scanning technology. The receiver lies in bed and
wakes up with a wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>Their interception technology also allows for virtual travel. They
can lie in bed, close their eyes to watch movies, play games, or
communicate with distant friends, all in a virtual setting.</p>
<p>They can even engage in virtual sexual activities with distant
partners of the opposite sex while lying in bed, through interception
technology.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6---walking-on-the-alien-street">Chapter 6 - Walking on
the Alien Street</h2>
<p>We walked out of the UFO warehouse and hadn’t gone far when suddenly
the surrounding environment changed drastically. In an instant, we found
ourselves on a main street in their planet’s city. To my surprise, the
planet was nothing like I had imagined.</p>
<p>Everywhere I looked, there were incredibly tall buildings, some so
tall that you couldn’t see the top. I thought to myself that it wasn’t
practical to build them so long without breaks in between to allow
pedestrians and cars to pass through more easily. Why would they build
them like this?</p>
<p>Everything on the main street was very orderly and simple. Not only
were the buildings exceptionally tidy and minimalist in design, but even
the roads were impeccably clean and flawless, paved in a blue hue made
of a material that seemed like plastic.</p>
<p>Along the roadside were many strange and unusual plants, all arranged
in neat rows.</p>
<p>I didn’t see any cars or any form of transportation. There were no
wires in sight, nor could I see any planes in the sky, and of course,
their UFOs were nowhere to be seen, probably moving too fast to be
visible. There were no shops, hotels, or any commercial buildings
either.</p>
<p>Many of the towering buildings, much like the UFO warehouse, had
virtual walls, while some were clearly real structures, though not as
tall as the virtual ones.</p>
<p>The virtual buildings had areas on the walls in different colors and
sizes, matching the positions of doors and windows, leading me to
believe these colored areas represented the virtual doors and
windows.</p>
<p>Some buildings had no doors or windows at all, and others were
floating in the air without any support. Many of the high-rise buildings
were inverted triangles, some so tall they seemed to be in space. Some
buildings had huge, possibly linguistic symbols floating above them,
resembling English, with no apparent connection to the buildings
themselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/4xerh9AVJ7YQOvf.png" width="303" height="404"></p>
<p>At that moment, I realized I was truly on an alien planet, and it
couldn’t possibly be anywhere on Earth. From what I had seen in movies,
no country on Earth looked like this. The last bit of hope I had,
thinking I might still be on Earth, was completely shattered.</p>
<p>At this moment, the standard male voice that often echoed in my mind
suddenly switched to the voice of a very sweet and extremely enchanting
little girl. It could be described as enchanting to the core, which I
later learned was synthesized by their artificial intelligence, not a
human voice.</p>
<p>"Welcome, Brother Qian from Earth, to the Guoker Planet System for a
tour. The Guoker GIW is dedicated to serving you."</p>
<p>In terms of our current understanding, this girl’s voice would be
equivalent to our mobile network’s AI customer service, and their GIW is
akin to our Earth’s internet.</p>
<p>However, my initial anxiety eased a bit, adopting a mindset of "when
in Rome, do as the Romans do."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a three-dimensional virtual hologram appeared before me,
showing an extremely beautiful girl with somewhat sinister features, who
continued with her extremely enchanting voice:</p>
<p>"The Guoker planet you are about to visit is a highly virtualized
world and also a lascivious one. Why lascivious? Did I hear that right,
or misunderstand? I wondered at that time. It is known in the universe
as a planet of sexual gaming. After returning from this planet, I truly
understood this point... I am Kevin, your private service agent from the
Guoker GIW, and I will do my best to provide information services to
you, the visitor from Earth, regardless of the situation. You will
receive my intimate and private services. I am your lovely,
sweet..."</p>
<p>As she spoke, her body shrank and moved closer to me, her clothes
melting away until the hologram seemed to enter my chest and disappear.
Strangely, I felt a sensation on my body and even seemed to smell a
young girl’s fragrance. Was this not purely a virtual image?</p>
<p>Feeling as if I was naked, I instinctively looked at the white
mist-like virtual image around my waist, which reassured me a bit.</p>
<p>Why did she say Guoker is a lascivious planet? Is it common to
introduce one’s home in such a way?</p>
<p>I instinctively touched my ears, wondering if there was a translator
inside. I found nothing.</p>
<p>I wanted to look in a mirror but thought it might be difficult to
find one or they might not have mirrors, so I dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>I noticed that the sunlight on this planet was particularly
brilliant, but slightly cold, not warm on the skin. The scenery was
exceptionally vivid, and visibility was excellent, making even distant
objects appear clear. The colors of the plants were mostly green, with
many shades between green and yellow, but noticeably more vibrant than
those on Earth.</p>
<p>Later on, I learned that their planet also revolves around a luminous
star, receiving starlight energy on its surface that is clearly less
intense per unit area compared to the sunlight we receive on Earth. The
plants, having evolved over a long period, are vividly colored, likely
to enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>This could also be due to the very low levels of dust and particulate
matter in their air.</p>
<p>They cover the ground completely, with the roots of the plants at the
surface boundary wrapped in special materials. In urban areas, the
ground is covered with a material similar to plastic, which is an
upgrade from our concrete on Earth. It’s extremely durable, somewhat
elastic, and produces very little dust when rubbed against other
materials.</p>
<p>There are no deserts or barren lands in their wilderness; the
vegetation is lush. The banks and dams of rivers are all covered with
man-made structures.</p>
<p>Not only do they prevent dust from dispersing into the air, but they
also have a dedicated dust absorption system that operates
continuously.</p>
<p>Their industries use artificial field scanning for cold processing,
emitting no smoke, with most industrial activities taking place on
another industrial planet.</p>
<p>Moreover, their ten billion global population shares a single mode of
transportation—the Global Movement Web. By submitting a movement
request, one can appear anywhere on the globe within a second.</p>
<p>Thus, there are no cars, trains, or planes to stir up dust from the
ground. Their environmental conservation is exceptional, almost to an
excessive degree.</p>
<p>However, they warned me that for Earthlings, living there for an
extended period could severely degrade immune functions. This is of
little concern to them, as their medical technology is highly advanced
and can easily address this issue.</p>
<p>The streets are not crowded, with people walking in a relaxed manner,
alone or in small groups. Some walk about a meter above the ground in a
cruising posture without carrying anything.</p>
<p>I also noticed that these people were clearly male or female, all
about one meter tall, of a similar age, and all very beautiful and
young, resembling our primary school or kindergarten children. There
were no elderly or infants to be seen.</p>
<p>Seeing their crowd, my first impression was like seeing scenes from
our kindergarten at the end of the day.</p>
<p>These people are all very delicate, with extremely smooth and soft
skin, flawless, and seem to have a diffuse reflection rather than a
mirror-like one.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that their appearance can be remotely modified using
their GMW and GIW, much like how we use beauty filters on TikTok now.
What I saw of their appearance wasn’t entirely real.</p>
<p>The women’s clothing seemed to blend seamlessly with their bodies,
with simple styles, usually exposing their arms, wearing tight-fitting
tank tops, very close-fitting, as if the exposed upper body was just
colored in, and paired with a small skirt-like garment for the lower
body. Their attire was very revealing, typical of summer attire.</p>
<p>Some people had patterns on their clothes that kept changing, like
our television screens.</p>
<p>Almost everyone walked barefoot.</p>
<p>Women’s hair generally flared outward, in spirals, while men’s hair
was usually tightly compressed against their heads, in various vibrant
colors.</p>
<p>I also noticed a phenomenon where many people, regardless of gender,
had a three-dimensional hologram floating beside their shoulders or
above their heads. The contents of the holograms were diverse, some
resembling small animals, some like text, some like complex machines,
some unidentifiable, and some patterns constantly changing.</p>
<p>I wondered in my mind, what were these floating above their
heads?</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/EnSOWGLhZyq2vQ5.jpg" width="107" height="205"></p>
<p>Figure: Guoker person with virtual creatures on his head, shoulders,
and near the feet</p>
<p>"This is the remote virtual imaging technology of the artificial
field scan, it’s like a signature, a tag, a self-display, a show-off,
and also represents one’s personality," explained Kevin, the GIW
customer service.</p>
<p>But I still didn’t quite understand and continued to ask Willie.</p>
<p>"Oh, it can be a kind of pet for humans, representing one’s mood.
It’s variable. Today, there may be one pattern floating above, and
tomorrow there may be another," Willie replied, but I still didn’t quite
understand.</p>
<p>"Ah, I can’t understand. I can only guess that the patterns floating
above their heads are just personal preferences, a way to show off,
without any real use," I said.</p>
<p>"How do you find the air on our planet?" asked Suldair.</p>
<p>"It’s very good," my attention shifted to the air, feeling refreshed,
"Your air has a higher oxygen content than on Earth, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it’s 23.18 percent," Suldair said, "The key is the negative
ions and some other gases in the air. The air on your Earth is a bit
bad. We’ve tried higher oxygen levels before and found many organisms
and bodies couldn’t adapt. After repeated experiments, we determined
that this oxygen content is the best."</p>
<p>Norton faced me and said, "Now, we’re heading back to our place.
Later on, we’ll give you a detailed tour of our planet. How does that
sound?"</p>
<p>"Alright. How far is your place from here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"In terms of length units on your Earth, it’s about over 10,000
kilometers," Norton replied.</p>
<p>"Then how do we get there? Do we take some form of transportation or
fly there in a UFO?"</p>
<p>No one answered me. Norton raised his hand and made a sudden gesture.
Suddenly, I heard the gentle and beautiful voice of the information
network customer service, Kevin, in my ear: "Request for teleportation
attachment approved. Type: humanoid."</p>
<p>I felt a lightness in my body, then quickly returned to normal.
Suddenly, I heard the same phrase again: "We’re home!"</p>
<p>Over 10,000 kilometers in such a short time? It was so easy to get to
their place? What kind of transportation did they use? Was it even more
advanced than a UFO? I didn’t see anything, just Norton waving his hand,
and my mind was filled with questions.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7---witnessing-instantaneous-travel-and-gmw-global-public-movement-web">Chapter
7 - Witnessing Instantaneous Travel and GMW (Global Public Movement
Web)</h2>
<p>We arrived directly inside Norton’s residence, unlike on Earth where
you first reach the exterior of a home before entering through the main
door.</p>
<p>Norton’s house was incredibly tidy and beautiful, complete with
virtual walls, a virtual bed, and a virtual sofa. There was also
something that looked like a table, which was clearly a physical object
at first glance.</p>
<p>Sitting on the virtual sofa felt incredibly comfortable, as if an
invisible force was supporting us.</p>
<p>I then moved to the bed, finding it equally comfortable. I wondered
aloud, "What happens if you turn off the virtual bed?"</p>
<p>"You’ll fall to the ground, that’s what," Suldair said, and with a
sudden press of a button, I indeed fell to the ground. Although the fall
wasn’t from a high place, it hurt a bit since I was naked, but I tried
to act as if it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>"You are rude!" Willie and Norton expressed their disapproval.</p>
<p>Suldair pressed the button again, and the virtual bed reappeared,
pushing me up with an unseen force. But I didn’t dare to sit on the bed
again and chose the sofa instead.</p>
<p>"Are you Feeling tired from the journey?" Willie asked, sitting
beside me.</p>
<p>"The journey itself wasn’t tiring, but I feel a bit heavier on your
planet, and walking barefoot is somewhat challenging," I answered,
turning my body away from Willie. The feeling of being naked, despite
still seeing the white mist-like virtual image around my waist,
instinctively made me feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>Later, on their planet, every time I suddenly faced a woman, the
sensation of being naked made me involuntarily and hastily check if the
white mist-like virtual pattern around my waist was still there.</p>
<p>I discovered that the inhabitants of the Guoker planet were also
essentially naked, with their clothes being virtual. However, they were
used to it and didn’t have my habit of hastily checking their lower
bodies upon encountering the opposite sex.</p>
<p>After returning from the alien planet, I still had this habit. Every
time I met a young woman, I would hastily check myself, a behavior that
lasted for many years before I gradually managed to change it.</p>
<p>"Our planet has stronger gravity than Earth, so you feel heavier
here. It can be uncomfortable all the time," Norton explained. "I will
request the Global Public Movement Web (GMW) to reduce your weight."</p>
<p>"What?" I was incredulous. "How can a person’s weight be reduced
through GMW? Without removing anything from the body, how can weight be
externally reduced? And what exactly is this GMW?"</p>
<p>"We traveled over ten thousand kilometers from the UFO warehouse here
using the GMW," Norton continued. He then swiped his hand over a table,
and a delicate white mist immediately appeared above it. Shortly after,
the mist transformed into a three-dimensional screen, similar to the one
I had seen in the UFO, displaying many alien characters. I noticed these
alien characters somewhat resembled English, being composed of basic
alphabetical combinations, unlike our pictographic Chinese
characters.</p>
<p>With graceful hand movements, Norton operated the device, and a
gentle female voice emerged near my ear: "Welcome to the Global Public
Movement Web..."</p>
<p>After Norton worked on it for a while, I suddenly felt my body
lighten, noticeably more relaxed. It was incredibly strange; what had
Norton done? He said it was the GMW, but what exactly is that?</p>
<p>Norton explained, "The primary equipment of the GMW is an artificial
field generator orbiting our planet, similar to your Earth’s
geostationary satellites. It rotates in sync with our planet, which also
rotates on its axis. However, these artificial field generators are much
larger than your Earth’s satellites."</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/CpDqgJzO76BkGnt.png" width="322" height="430"></p>
<p>Our planet has nine of these generators covering the entire globe.
These devices can project a special, artificially created field——an
artificial field, essentially affecting space and, consequently, any
object within that space.</p>
<p>The artificial field generator, along with the global positioning
system, computers, and the GIW, forms the GMW.</p>
<p>When we want to travel and seek assistance from the GMW, the process
is roughly as follows: we first send our travel request information
through the GIW to the artificial field generator in space.</p>
<p>The field generator first confirms your identity. Once verified, it
locks onto your location through the global positioning system, then
targets both your current location and your destination. You can
disappear from your current location and appear at your desired
destination almost instantly.</p>
<p>Because this process is too fast to perceive, we typically refer to
this mode of transport as ‘instantaneous travel’ ."</p>
<p>"Unbelievable. The GMW is invisible and intangible, yet also very
complex," I said. "This is incredible, even more so than flying saucers,
and it’s user-friendly to boot. Passengers don’t need to bring anything
with them. So why don’t you use the GMW to travel to other planets?"</p>
<p>"The range of the GMW is limited to a single planet," Norton replied.
"The reason is that the artificial field generator only targets the
ground, and its range is limited. To travel from one planet to another,
we can only use flying saucers."</p>
<p>"It seems the core of GMW is the artificial field generator, and
everything else is just auxiliary. So, what’s the basic principle of
this artificial field generator?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It’s the same as the basic principle of flying saucers. The
artificial field generator irradiates people, causing the space around
them, which is normally moving at the speed of light, to stop moving.
This movement at the speed of light is what gives mass to people and
objects. Once a person’s mass is reduced to zero, they can move at the
speed of light, and when they reach their destination, the movement of
space around them is restored to its original state.</p>
<p>If there’s something in the way, the mass of that obstacle is also
reduced to zero, allowing for unobstructed, barrier-free passage through
it.</p>
<p>However, this reduction of mass to zero is a relative concept. I
might feel that my mass has been reduced to zero, while you might think
there’s been no change," Norton explained, leaving me somewhat confused
and incredulous.</p>
<p>"So, you’re saying that two solid objects can pass through each other
without any barriers under the irradiation of the artificial field
generator, right?" I asked. "Why don’t the molecules in the solids block
each other?"</p>
<p>Norton answered, "Ordinary objects are made of atoms, which consist
of nuclei and electrons around the nucleus, with the volume of electrons
and nuclei only accounting for a tiny fraction of an atom’s volume.
Normally, a person walking up to a wall is blocked because the molecules
and atoms in the wall are held together by interaction forces,
essentially electromagnetic forces.</p>
<p>We are actually blocked by these electromagnetic forces. Without
these forces, we could easily pass through.</p>
<p>The artificial field device eliminates the electromagnetic forces in
objects, allowing two solids to easily pass through each other. However,
the disappearance of these electromagnetic forces is a relative concept.
To one person, they may seem to have disappeared, while to another, they
are still present."</p>
<p>Norton’s explanation had me feeling dizzy.</p>
<p>"So, the artificial field generator can reduce the mass of objects. I
feel lighter now because the artificial field generator is constantly
tracking me and reducing my mass, but not completely reducing it to
zero, just lessening it, right?" I asked Norton.</p>
<p>"Right, you’re smart. That’s exactly how it works," Norton said.</p>
<p>Willie added: "The floating people must have a reason to find him."
(Floating people means the highly advanced gas-form aliens I encountered
as I was a kid.)</p>
<p>"Brother Qian is definitely among the smart ones on Earth. Earthlings
are smart beings, but unfortunately, they spend their intelligence on
fighting each other, constantly bickering and using their wits in this
area," Suldair said.</p>
<p>"Another bad habit of Earthlings is dividing people into many levels,
thinking some are superior and emphasizing that others are inferior," he
continued.</p>
<p>"Am I considered superior or inferior on Earth?" Willie stared at me
and asked.</p>
<p>"I’m both. Right now, I’m only interested in the GMW," I told Norton.
"Is GMW omnipotent?"</p>
<p>"This artificial field device that can make people disappear
instantly isn’t omnipotent; it has many limitations."</p>
<p>"If the energy of this device does not reach a certain value, the
artificial field it generates cannot make a person disappear instantly
when irradiated. If the mass of the object required to disappear
instantly is too large, or if the mass of many objects combined is too
large, the device won’t have enough power to operate. Moreover, if the
device operates unstably, a person trying to pass through a wall might
get stuck and lose their life," Norton continued to explain.</p>
<p>"Creating an instantaneous disappearance for an object as large as a
planet requires much more energy compared to a person, consuming an
astonishing amount of energy. Making a person pass through a wall is
easy, but making someone pass through a planet requires an
extraordinarily high power from the artificial field device, consuming a
tremendous amount of energy, otherwise, the person might get stuck
inside the planet, leading to death. In reality, we don’t have such
high-powered artificial field devices."</p>
<p>I still had many questions about the GMW.</p>
<p>"What if a small room suddenly receives many requests for entry?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"The request for the GMW is highly intelligent; in such cases, it
only allows the people who applied first. Subsequent applicants cannot
pass through. The GMW is not only highly intelligent but also integrated
with the global information network," Suldair explained.</p>
<p>"The GMW will alert you: the space you wish to reach is full, your
request for movement is not supported by the GMW this time, and you may
choose another time or delay," Willie’s explanation sounded very similar
to the warm messages I often hear from the information network customer
service in my ear.</p>
<p>"I want to appear in a bank vault at night, filling my bag with
bundles of cash. Appearing in a beautiful girl’s room at night, ah, to
make her and myself—wouldn’t society become chaotic?" I said.</p>
<p>"Ha ha," Suldair laughed, his body shaking with the rhythm of his
laughter. "You Earthlings are all about this, with such petty
ambitions.</p>
<p>The GMW is highly intelligent. When you request it to appear in a
bank vault or in a beautiful girl’s room, it pops up a virtual screen
saying: ‘Sorry, your request violates relevant laws, the GMW does not
support it.’</p>
<p>When you request to appear in the dangerous seas, the GMW pops up a
screen saying: ‘The GMW kindly reminds you that the sea is a dangerous
area, make sure to bring online devices for a safe return.’</p>
<p>If you don’t carry a computer or a phone for online access, the GMW
pops up a screen saying: ‘Sorry, our network detected that you do not
carry a computer or other online devices, we cannot ensure your safe
return, this transit request is not supported.’</p>
<p>When you make a careless click on the computer requesting the GMW to
transport you to a spot ten meters above the ground, the GMW immediately
alerts you: ‘The network will comply with your instruction, fulfilling
your movement request for your safety, by default, transporting you to
the ground, ten meters directly below your chosen location.’</p>
<p>When you request the GMW to transport you to another planet, the
screen pops up saying: ‘Sorry, the GMW can only transport people and
objects within a global range, your request exceeds our
capabilities.’</p>
<p>When you find a beautiful mountain and request the GMW b to move it
to your home, the screen pops up saying: ‘Sorry, the GMW for ordinary
users like you can only transport personnel and objects not exceeding
one hundred tons within a global range, your request exceeds your
rights.’</p>
<p>When you see something belonging to someone else and request the GMW
to move it to your residence, the screen pops up saying: ‘This is
someone else’s property, your request violates relevant laws, this
transit network does not support it.’’</p>
<p>Suldair explained a lot in one go, clearing up many of my
questions.</p>
<p>I’m utterly amazed by this GMW. How wonderful it would be if such a
thing existed on Earth! I dream of going to the United States, finding
the address I want to visit through the information network, and then,
with the press of a confirmation button, I appear at that place in the
US. To return, I simply find the address of my hometown, press the
confirmation button again, and I’m instantly back home. How magical and
convenient that would be!</p>
<p>"Oh, I get it now. Your streets have no cars, no trains, no planes,
no form of transportation at all. People don’t carry bags when they go
out, and your homes don’t store many items. That’s because you have the
GMW, making it too easy to travel and transport goods," I said.</p>
<p>"There’s no need for stores either since you can directly receive
goods from the manufacturer’s warehouse. And no hotels or inns, because
no matter how far away you are, you can always quickly return home."</p>
<p>"Yes, that’s exactly the kind of society we are," Suldair
responded.</p>
<p>"The miraculous GMW makes everything simple, fast, safe, and
efficient!" I exclaimed. "Can I request the GMW to take me
everywhere?"</p>
<p>"You can’t, because you don’t have an identity. But, if you were
considered as someone’s belonging," Norton said, "like if you were my
luggage that I carry around all the time, I could request the GMW to
take you with me. You’re from another planet and can’t obtain an
identity here. Only people from our planet can have one.</p>
<p>Later you’ll see that the GMW has many more important uses. If Earth
had this network, it would drastically impact your life, studies, work,
scientific research, and more. It would significantly change the layout
of your cities since people wouldn’t need to crowd together.</p>
<p>It could even lead to the disappearance of countries and wars on
Earth, as combatants could be forcibly separated through the GMW.</p>
<p>Our eating habits and how our bodies gain energy largely rely on the
global transportation network.</p>
<p>The GMW could also change societal moral values and laws. Society
doesn’t demand morality and laws because if someone wanted to do harm,
it could immediately prevent it, making it impossible for bad deeds to
succeed."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. So, if it suddenly stopped, you’d all be in grave danger,
right?" I remarked.</p>
<p>"That’s correct!" They replied in unison.</p>
<p>"Our two major webs are constantly locating and tracking every
individual on the planet, providing them with various services at all
times. These services only stop if the individual leaves their planet,"
Suldair explained.</p>
<p>"You’re also building the internet on Earth now, and eventually, it
will become similar to our GIW. However, you still don’t have a GMW.</p>
<p>Our GIW can constantly provide everyone with communication, inquiry,
location, greetings, translation, and various identity verification and
authentication services. Our GIW transmits information through pure
space, using long-distance, non-contact artificial field scans to
provide services, all for free.</p>
<p>Our artificial field scanning technology can remotely read the
thoughts and consciousness in everyone’s brain and input information
remotely into anyone’s brain through space. People can directly exchange
and send information through space using artificial field scanning,
meaning individuals can communicate directly over long distances through
the GIW. This is our artificial field scanning and frequency
interception technology."</p>
<p>"Why do you still use external computers?" I asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, too much information directly entering the human brain
can cause interference, making people feel annoyed. That’s why many of
us also use various computer devices externally," Norton explained to
me.</p>
<p>"The constant tracking by our GIW and GMW is incredibly powerful,
giving each of us, no matter where we go, immense capabilities. It’s
precisely because these two webs are always tracking us and providing
various services that we can be anywhere without facing danger. The two
webs offer us reliable safety guarantees," Suldair said.</p>
<p>"If anything happens that poses a real threat to our people, our GMW,
which is highly intelligent, can quickly move people to safety. Our GIW
not only provides various information services at all times but also can
remotely and non-invasively record a person’s thoughts and
consciousness.</p>
<p>If a person experiences a special accident and loses their life, the
GIW can completely record that person’s thoughts and consciousness. It’s
possible to install the recorded thoughts and consciousness into the
brain of an artificially created human through artificial field scanning
technology, essentially reviving that person."</p>
<p>Later, I realized that the GIW on the planet Guoker provides them
with information services, while the GMW offers services related to
transportation, manufacturing, and daily activities, essentially
extending their capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8---the-interesting-guoker-people">Chapter 8 - The
Interesting Guoker People</h2>
<p>While sitting on the virtual couch at Norton’s place, I started
feeling hungry. "Hey, I’m getting a bit hungry. What do you all usually
eat?" I asked.</p>
<p>Norton replied, "We forgot about that; your Earthling way of eating
is different from ours."</p>
<p>"And how do you usually eat?"</p>
<p>"Our bodies also need energy from food’s chemical energy. We have GMW
that can teleport food directly into our bodies when we need it, usually
in liquid form, which our bodies can almost fully utilize," Norton
answered.</p>
<p>"The liquid comes in bottles, right? Do you also teleport the bottles
into your stomachs? How do you digest the bottles?" I asked.</p>
<p>Suldair said, "We don’t need bottles for teleportation. We don’t have
stomachs, nor intestines, livers, kidneys, or bladders. Our bodies, from
the mouth down, are just a simple cavity. Our food is highly processed
and can be directly utilized by our bodies.</p>
<p>Many of our bodily functions, like breathing, digestion, and
excretion, are outsourced to external systems. This makes our body
structure simple, more efficient, and less prone to illness.</p>
<p>It’s only the primitive and backward bodies of Earthlings that have
stomachs, intestines, livers, kidneys, bladders—it’s all so complicated
and troublesome. In fact, when our body energy is low, the GMW teleports
food energy directly into our bodies, all under computer control,
without any hassle on our part."</p>
<p>"Now, I’ll request the global transportation network to send food for
you," Norton said, and with a sharp swipe near his ear, a sophisticated
bottle and a metallic scissor appeared on the table in Norton’s home.
The bottle, shaped somewhat like a penguin and silver in color, seemed
to be made of metal, with a protrusion like a penguin’s beak.</p>
<p>Norton used a curved scissor to snip off the elongated part of the
bottle and handed it to me. I took a drink from the bottle, enjoying the
floral scent and a mild sweet taste that was very pleasant. I finished
it in one go, put the bottle back on the table, and immediately felt not
hungry anymore.</p>
<p>With another gesture near his ear, the bottle, the piece cut from it,
and the scissors vanished. I guessed they were teleported back by the
GMW.</p>
<p>"Why can you request the GMW to teleport things with a wave of your
hand near your ear? Is there a switch there?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Norton explained, "The brains of our people are linked to the GIW
through an artificial field scan. The idea to request assistance from
the GMW originates in the mind; the hand gesture near the ear is just
for confirmation. We could set other actions for confirmation, like
nodding, clenching a fist, stamping a foot... People usually choose a
gesture that’s unlikely to be misunderstood, though some stick to their
own style, even if it often leads to mistakes, unwilling to change."</p>
<p>"You call it eating; we refer to it as replenishing our bodies with
chemical energy, usually through a set computer program." Whenever our
bodies run low on energy, they automatically send a signal to the GIW.
Then, through the GIW, our body’s hunger signal is sent to the GMW.
After confirming our identities, it teleports liquid chemical energy
directly into our bodies. It can also remove some of the waste products
from our bodies. Everything is controlled by an automated program, so it
doesn’t require any effort from us. Essentially, it outsources our
bodies’ functions of ingestion, digestion, and excretion."</p>
<p>"Hoho, so without the GMW, you couldn’t survive," I teased them,
imitating Suldair’s tone. "So, you can’t eat on the Zone Map 300
spaceship?"</p>
<p>"The Zone Map 300 spaceship also has its own web and can perform
teleportation just as easily to replenish our energy, though it’s
invisible to you," Suldair explained. "Without the GMW, we can still
drink liquid food with our mouths and chew with our teeth. It’s just
that we aren’t used to it anymore. Our bodies are just simple cavities
without the complex digestive organs you Earthlings have, as our
digestive function has degenerated. We could probably manage to eat, but
not as effectively as you Earthlings."</p>
<p>"I’m a bit confused. If your brains can connect to the GMW, acting
like a biological computer, why do I often see you operating those
virtual screen computers? Can’t you just use your brains directly?" I
asked Norton, referencing his actions on the Zone Map 300 spaceship.</p>
<p>"The biological computer capabilities of our bodies are not as
powerful as external computers. Many functions on the Zone Map 300
spaceship are not allowed to be directly controlled by our brains. There
are restrictions on our planet against such actions. People on our
planet can directly request the GMW through their brains, virtually
going anywhere on Gok at will. However, interstellar spaceships can
travel beyond Guoker planet and carry certain risks. Not everyone is
allowed to pilot a spaceship, and even those who are permitted must
receive authorization," Norton explained seriously. "You must
understand, the built-in biological computer in our bodies has a lot of
flexibility, but for tasks like piloting the Zone Map 300 spaceship,
seriousness and caution are required. Therefore, external computers are
safer and more suitable than internal biological computers."</p>
<p>"Oh, I get it now. Your Guoker planet is also orderly and acts
rationally, not allowing reckless behavior," I suddenly remembered to
ask, "Oh, Norton, what about your family?"</p>
<p>"What family?" Norton seemed surprised.</p>
<p>"Just you at home? What about your parents, your wife, do you have
any children?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it’s just me," Norton answered.</p>
<p>Ah! I can’t expect that Norton, a biological scientist from Guoker
planet, would be all alone. "What about your family, Suldair? How many
people do you have in your household?"</p>
<p>"Just me."</p>
<p>"And you?" I turned to Willie, "How many people are in your family?
What about your parents, do you have any siblings?" Seeing Willie
reminded me of a kindergartener on Earth, I hesitated to ask if she had
any children.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? It’s just me," Willie seemed
puzzled.</p>
<p>"Ah! All three of you are in such a situation, all orphans with no
one else in your families. How pathetic!"</p>
<p>They can live forever, I thought to myself. Given the advanced
technology I’ve seen on Guoker planet, achieving immortality seemed
plausible. How did they achieve humanity’s greatest dream of living
forever?</p>
<p>"Really? You can live forever?" I asked Suldair, somewhat skeptical,
then turned to Norton for confirmation.</p>
<p>"Yes, we can live forever. Many years ago, our planet achieved this
technology," Norton confirmed Suldair’s statement. "We don’t give birth,
and we don’t die. So, there are no old people, no children, and no
parents, offspring, or siblings. Each of us is a family on our own."</p>
<p>"Having a family of just one person must be lonely," I commented.</p>
<p>"We have pets at home. I have many pets, and we can talk to our pets
and other animals," Willie said. "I also have two robots that take care
of me."</p>
<p>"Do you have animals like cats and dogs on your planet? How do you
communicate with animals?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes, we have many animals, and some breeds of our cats and dogs are
similar to those on Earth. It’s possible that these breeds were
introduced from Earth," Norton answered. "We can translate our language
into one that animals like cats and dogs can understand, then use an
artificial field scan to send the information directly to their brains.
The artificial field scan can also translate the animals’ language into
something we can understand. This way, we can communicate back and forth
with animals like cats and dogs through the artificial field scan.</p>
<p>However, being an Earthling, you can’t yet understand what it’s like
to communicate with animals like cats and dogs. We might not have the
program for you to experience it. You could think of it as talking to a
person with intellectual disabilities. But, this doesn’t hinder our
ability to continue interacting with animals."</p>
<p>"It also doesn’t prevent us from engaging in sexual activities with
animals, which is quite common on Guoker planet. However, in the eyes of
Earthlings, this would be seen as a terrible thing," Suldair’s statement
shocked me, prompting me to change the subject.</p>
<p>"Do you have spouses or opposite-gender friends?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we do, but generally, we don’t live together. The relationship
lasts for a while, not permanently, and there’s no legal registration
like on Earth," Suldair answered.</p>
<p>"You are fascinating. I’d love to go out and walk among your people,
and see what your daily life is like. Then I could go back to Earth and
boast to everyone, share what it’s like here."</p>
<p>"Norton said, "We’ll definitely take you out later. You just arrived
today and might be tired. Rest here for now."</p>
<p>"Alright, sounds good!"</p>
<p>"We’ll take our leave now. See you here tomorrow." As the customer
service of the GIW translated Suldair and Willie’s words for me, I
noticed they vanished from Norton’s home instantly. No need to guess;
they must have used the global public transportation network to teleport
back to their own homes.</p>
<p>The GMW on the planet can make people and objects suddenly appear or
disappear in a place, even in sealed rooms.</p>
<p>"I’d like to take a shower. Do you have anything for that? Do you
shower?" I asked Norton.</p>
<p>"Yes, let me take you there."</p>
<p>Following Norton, I entered a small room. He pressed a switch, and
suddenly a milky-white bathtub appeared, floating in mid-air. Its pure
white color was too pristine and it was swirling about - obviously, a
virtual bathtub, a product of an artificial field.</p>
<p>I stepped in, noticing the water was real, flowing from one end of
the tub to the other in a continuous stream. I wondered how the bathtub
kept producing water without end and where it stored all the water it
absorbed. Such a phenomenon would be inconceivable on Earth.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to ask Norton how the bathtub worked, I
remembered their GMW. Using the web to teleport water into one end of
the tub and then away from the other end seemed like the obvious
solution.</p>
<p>I jumped into the bathtub and immediately felt the water was real,
though the bathtub was virtual—my judgment was spot-on. The water was
slightly warmer than my body temperature, making lying in it quite
comfortable. I felt the urge to urinate. Earlier, with the girl Wei Li
present, I was too embarrassed to ask Norton where I could relieve
myself. Now, in the bathtub, I just went ahead and did it. Would Norton
find out? Would he blame me? I thought, who cares?</p>
<p>After urinating, I took a refreshing shower. Just as I stepped out of
the virtual bathtub, in the blink of an eye, it vanished without a
trace, seemingly spirited away by the miraculous GMW.</p>
<p>Norton’s virtual bed was so comfortable that I had a wonderful sleep.
When I woke up, I saw Suldair, Willie, and Norton already chatting on
the virtual sofa. I wanted to join their conversation but suddenly felt
the urgent need to defecate. Too embarrassed to ask and unable to hold
it back, I blurted out, "Where’s your toilet?"</p>
<p>"We don’t have toilets. We don’t need to defecate or urinate,"
Suldair said, "Our excretions are even less than your earwax."</p>
<p>"There should still be a place for our guest to relieve himself,"
Norton said.</p>
<p>It was quite embarrassing to have a girl guide me to relieve myself,
but given the urgency, I had no choice but to follow Willie.</p>
<p>We reached a spot among some plants where I squatted down. Seeing
Willie nearby made me feel somewhat uncomfortable. She was dressed
strikingly today, in a shiny, metallic-looking, tight tank top that
accentuated her not-so-large but prominently long and rounded breasts.
Her short, shiny purple skirt looked normal from the front and back, but
not from the side. The side was bare, possibly because the skirt was
transparent on the sides, but this transparency was of such a high
quality that it seemed as if there was nothing there at all, suggesting
transparency rather than absence.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that their clothing was often not real but virtual,
created by the GMW and the GIW. It wasn’t actual fabric at all. If you
touched them, you would be touching bare skin unless they requested a
protective force field from the GMW, which would make it feel
different.</p>
<p>Willie’s delicate, fair skin exposed on the side of her lower body
was startling and provocative.</p>
<p>I glanced once and felt too embarrassed to look again. I thought to
myself, even when our Earth women reveal skin, they cover the
essentials. These people, on the other hand, seemed to prefer exposing
those parts. I internally criticized them for their shamelessness,
suddenly remembering Kevin’s description of their planet as one of
debauchery.</p>
<p>I consider myself quite conservative. I once was digging for eels
when a woman from the city asked me to help her and her young daughter
cross a ditch. They were afraid of leeches and bugs in the water. After
carrying her daughter across, the woman hinted she wanted me to carry
her too. Seeing her in a very short skirt, revealing her tender thighs,
I didn’t have the courage to carry her.</p>
<p>She then suggested I carry her on my back, but seeing her prominent
breasts, I lost my courage again. The woman, misunderstanding my
hesitation as unwillingness, angrily called me a bad person for a long
while. She eventually took off her shoes, gritted her teeth, and waded
through the water herself, leaving me feeling guilty for a long
time.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Norton’s place, I suggested we go out for a walk to
get a feel for the daily life of the Guoker people.</p>
<p>Norton said, "Let’s do that next time. Today, we’re expecting many
important guests. You’ll get to see a variety of Guoker people right
here."</p>
<p>Soon, quite a few people arrived at Norton’s home, and the living
room started to feel cramped. With a wave of his hand, Norton made a
virtual wall disappear, instantly expanding the living room several
times over. It seemed that virtual housing was quite convenient.</p>
<p>Suldair, Willie, and I were sitting on a virtual sofa, with me in the
middle. Willie was dressed too provocatively for the day, and I felt an
invisible pressure sitting naked between them, so I kept some distance
from her.</p>
<p>I also noticed an interesting phenomenon: some people appeared
suddenly on the virtual sofa at Norton’s, while others materialized
slowly from a cloud of smoke into a person. I asked Suldair what this
was all about.</p>
<p>"Those who appear suddenly are real people coming through the GMW.
The ones transforming from smoke are light virtual people; their real
bodies aren’t here, but they can converse with us from afar through the
GIW. The ones slowly transforming from smoke are not real people;
they’re virtual, created by three-dimensional imaging technology by the
GIW and the GMW. However, these virtual people can directly interact
with us," Suldair explained.</p>
<p>Looking closely, these virtual people seemed indistinguishable from
real ones. Was Suldair pulling my leg? Without further ado, I stood up,
walked over to a person who had materialized from smoke, and reached out
to touch them. As expected, my hand moved through the air, touching
nothing.</p>
<p>Despite being prepared, I was still shocked and couldn’t help but
marvel at the Guoker people’s advanced technology, which had taken
virtual tech to the pinnacle of perfection.</p>
<p>The visitors at Norton’s home varied in appearance but were all the
same height, indistinguishable to my eyes. They seemed to be holding a
symposium, with Norton moving among the crowd like a moderator.</p>
<p>With many people around, the GIW’s customer service, Kevin, mainly
translated for Norton, Suldair, and Willie. If I paid attention to a
stranger, I would receive translations of their speech; otherwise, the
customer service generally wouldn’t translate.</p>
<p>I figured the Public Information Network must be highly intelligent
and possibly tracking my location at all times.</p>
<p>Norton went on and on about the physical structure of us Earthlings,
occasionally introducing me to the body structure and physiological
characteristics of the Guoker people.</p>
<p>I wasn’t really paying attention because many women from their planet
had arrived, or perhaps they should be called girls, as they all
appeared extremely young and beautiful, much like the little girls in
our elementary schools or kindergartens on Earth.</p>
<p>These beautiful, sexy girls sat next to me, dressed in revealing
clothes similar to Willie’s outfit today—a tight tank top with a short
skirt, often exposing their delicate, fair skin from the side, which
made me itch with curiosity.</p>
<p>Norton and Willie seemed oblivious to my thoughts, only Suldair
appeared to understand.</p>
<p>He asked, "Your Earth women vary in appearance, some beautiful, some
not. So do you find all our Guoker women beautiful?</p>
<p>"Your standard of beauty seems to be based solely on a sexy figure
and exquisite bodies. I admit your skin is smooth and the color pure,
and your body structures are flawless. On Earth, beauty also encompasses
a person’s inner qualities, their thoughts and personality, their
temperament—something you may not understand," I replied with a bit of
deliberate profundity.</p>
<p>"If someone’s body was covered in spots and had many small bumps,
would you still find them beautiful?" Norton asked.</p>
<p>"Covered in spots and bumps, like a toad? That kind of person would
be considered beautiful? Really?" I laughed.</p>
<p>"Alright!" Norton seemed energized, "I’ll invite such a beauty right
now, to overturn your concept of beauty."</p>
<p>Norton touched his ear and paced back and forth. Suddenly, a
beautiful woman appeared before us, making my heart race. She was
scantily clad, her skin a fair white with a hint of pink. True to his
word, she was covered in pink spots, about the size of a match head,
evenly distributed. On closer inspection, the spots or bumps were
crystal clear, somewhat resembling pomegranate seeds.</p>
<p>This person looked incredibly beautiful and sexy at a glance. "How
about it? What do you think of this person?" Norton asked me.</p>
<p>"Um, this person is indeed very beautiful, I admit very sexy," I
conceded that her beauty and sexiness were still due to exquisiteness,
just in another form. But at that moment, I didn’t want to argue with
Norton and the others anymore.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9---why-would-guoker-people-abduct-earth-humans">Chapter
9 - Why Would Guoker People Abduct Earth Humans?</h2>
<p>I decided to change the topic and asked Norton, "Have you seen the
women of our planet? Do you find Earth women beautiful?"</p>
<p>Norton replied, "We have abducted Earthlings many times, and I myself
have gone on numerous occasions. We are quite familiar with Earthlings.
We often abduct people from Earth, and we frequently go to distant
planets in the universe to abduct people, bringing them to our planet.
In our eyes, based on our aesthetic standards, compared to women from
other planets, Earth women are not considered beautiful."</p>
<p>"Why do you abduct Earthlings then?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It’s not about beauty. When we abduct someone from another planet,
it’s not because they are attractive," Norton explained, "If we come to
Earth to abduct an Earthling, our main goal is to obtain digital
information about Earthling thought consciousness, memory, sensations,
various movements, and physiological activities. With our technology, we
can enable our people to have the same sensations and experiences as
Earthlings, which is essentially like swapping our bodies with those of
Earthlings to live for a while."</p>
<p>"Why would you want to swap your bodies with Earthlings and live as
them for a while?" I asked. "Are Earthling bodies great?"</p>
<p>Norton answered, "Earthlings pursue material wealth and power, which
we are not interested in. We seek the experience and sensations of
beings. Living in an Earthling’s body allows us to experience what it
feels like to be an Earthling. We often abduct people from other planets
so that we can frequently swap bodies and live, experiencing life for a
while. In our view, Earthling bodies are quite poor and not special.</p>
<p>In the universe, the three essentials for life are material
resources, energy, and information. Our technology is highly advanced;
material resources and energy are of no concern to us, as they are
freely available and of no interest.</p>
<p>We are only interested in information. Gathering information is our
main activity. Through digital information, we acquire wealth, which we
call the digital information economy, comprising about ninety-nine
percent or even more of our economy. Material resources and energy on
our planet are almost free in different sectors.</p>
<p>Abducting people from other planets, or abducting you Earthlings, and
obtaining information from Earthlings, can bring us immense wealth. For
example, if we captured a man from Earth and brought him to our planet,
we might force him to engage in various sexual activities with females
of different physical forms on our planet. We then record the detailed
digital information of this Earth man’s body, physiology, thought
consciousness, sensations, memories, and other movements. These digital
data can generate a lot of wealth for us.</p>
<p>After obtaining these digital data, we can widely promote and sell
them on our GIW under the name ‘Live and have sex with an Earth Man,’
making them available to many users. For instance, one of our female
users, after purchasing our data, can use our virtual technology to have
a three-dimensional virtual image of an Earth man follow her like a
shadow. This woman lives with a real Earth man, interacting and chatting
with him, and can even engage in virtual sexual activities.</p>
<p>Besides this 3D virtual companion technology, we also have a popular
3D physical companion technology. For instance, once a female purchases
our data, she can activate a gel-like substance. This substance, once
activated by the digital information, quickly comes to life and
instantly creates a person beside her who looks exactly like the Earth
man in appearance, height, and weight, with no discernible difference in
sight, touch, taste, and other senses.</p>
<p>Our female users can live with an Earth man as if he were real for a
period of time.</p>
<p>Users can talk and interact with the person formed from the gel
substance, even engage in sexual relations, feeling no different from
reality. Of course, this person formed from the gel substance is not a
simple robot. Their thoughts and actions are determined by the digital
information the user purchases.</p>
<p>If Earthlings were to capture an alien man, at most he would have sex
with a few Earth women a few times. It couldn’t become as widely popular
in society as quickly as with us. Through this technology, one Earth man
could live and have sex with tens of thousands of women from our planet
simultaneously.</p>
<p>We also have very bizarre customers who modify the simulated Earth
man’s body to be very small and live parasitically inside their own
body, carrying it everywhere; or make the simulated Earth man’s body
very large and have their own body live parasitically inside it. Or even
transform the simulated Earth man into a pet. The methods are diverse
and strange, with various bizarre and extreme ways far beyond your
imagination, which you might encounter in the future.</p>
<p>The benefit of the digital economy is that it’s not just about
satisfying one of our women but thousands of them. Thousands of our
women can purchase data and live as if with a real Earth man for a
while. This also depends on how popular our data would be.</p>
<p>Whenever we discover a new alien species and successfully abduct one,
the sex data becomes popular in our society for a while. It’s like the
pop songs on your Earth, where the main factors are novelty and
authenticity, not necessarily quality.</p>
<p>For instance, we could also fabricate an Earth man’s data, but even
if it offers a good user experience, it doesn’t sell well in the market
because users think these data are fake, just fabricated by us.</p>
<p>Now that we have actually abducted you from Earth, the digital
content created, plus the fact that we will take you around, will
generate a lot of interest among many users.</p>
<p>We also have men who purchase Earth men’s body data, and after
buying, they can store their body in a spacetime fridge and then apply
for an artificially made body like that of Earth men, injecting it with
the Earth men’s body data. This allows them to live in an Earth man’s
body for a while, gaining the experience of living as an Earth man."</p>
<p>"Now you understand, abducting you is quite worthwhile," Suldair said
with a somewhat eerie smile. "Unfortunately, Earthling body data are not
popular on our planet and are considered quite trashy."</p>
<p>"Why do you still abduct us Earthlings, including me?" I
complained.</p>
<p>"They say there’s something special in your brain," Willie slowly
said.</p>
<p>"Have all the abducted Earthlings been sent back?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Some were sent back, some were not sturdy enough and died on the
spot during experiments, or couldn’t withstand the sexual activities
with our Guoker women and were tortured to death, and some eventually
died of old age on our planet. You might ask why?" Suldair shook with
laughter. "Because we’re also quite lazy!"</p>
<p>Seeing my expression and mood were off, Willie comforted me, "Don’t
worry, Brother Qian, we’ll definitely return you. Your mind is unique,
not like anyone else’s—it’s valuable to us."</p>
<p>Later I learned if they abduct people from highly advanced planets,
they will treat them with great caution. Maybe they’re afraid of being
retaliated. But they do anything they want to us Earth people because we
can’t do anything about it.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-10---terrestrial-and-aquatic-species-in-the-universe">Chapter
10 - Terrestrial and Aquatic Species in the Universe</h2>
<p>Aside from us Earthlings and you Guoker people, are there many other
inhabited planets in the universe?</p>
<p>“Of course, we’ve discovered many, with even more varieties of
people,” Norton replied. “Although there are many types of beings in the
universe, most have evolved from lower life forms. From an evolutionary
perspective, there are two kinds: those who evolved from terrestrial
lower life forms, known as terrestrial-based beings.</p>
<p>Both Earthlings and our people evolved from land, making us
terrestrial-based. Although life on Earth originated in water, most of
your evolutionary process took place on land, so you would be considered
terrestrial-based. Terrestrial-based beings are the majority in the
universe.</p>
<p>Some animals, like what you on Earth call birds that can fly, are
also considered terrestrial-based, as their evolution started on land,
with most of their evolutionary process occurring there.</p>
<p>Those who evolved from aquatic lower life forms are known as
aquatic-based beings. We particularly like the aquatic-based beings;
many of us are fond of, or rather covet, the bodies of those evolved
from aquatic life.’</p>
<p>“Then, how do Earthlings fare among the many types of beings? Are we
considered superior?” I was curious about their view on our physical
form.</p>
<p>"Very bad," Willie added.</p>
<p>“Terrible,” Suldair added as well. “The physical evolution of
Earthlings is poor.”</p>
<p>"But why do we look similar?" I asked.</p>
<p>“It’s because we both come from terrestrial-based evolution,” Norton
explained. ’Terrestrial creatures, initially walking on four legs with a
head to navigate and direct movement, is the most superior pattern for
terrestrial life.</p>
<p>This pattern, resulting from long-term natural evolution and survival
of the fittest, shows why walking on three legs, due to instability, was
eliminated early on.</p>
<p>Later, hands and feet differentiated, allowing for upright walking,
simply because of tool-making and usage. For this reason, all beings
from terrestrial-based evolution eventually evolve into a similar
shape.</p>
<p>"So to speak, no matter how different the creatures were, they will
evolve into people like our form. That’s why the Guoker people look
similar to you Earth people. To sum up, it’s natural selection; only the
superior can survive in evolution.</p>
<p>That’s to say, different animals ultimately converge to the human
form we see now. Guoker people and Earthlings are similar in shape for
this reason. In short, it’s all down to natural selection, survival of
the fittest, and evolution.</p>
<p>"Later on, when we were able to artificially manufacture our own
bodies, why didn’t we create them in bizarre shapes? The reason isn’t
entirely due to traditional habits; it’s primarily determined by
aesthetic views. That is, everyone thought the previous bodies were
beautiful and sexy. Creating a strange shape would mean losing that
sense of beauty and allure. We have developed and manufactured some
unusual types of beings, but still, they revolve around the notions of
sexiness and beauty, never straying from this main focus."</p>
<p>With a wave of Norton’s hand, a three-dimensional holographic image
appeared, displaying a variety of people, all with limbs and heads,
standing upright.</p>
<p>Norton continued, "Compared to terrestrial-evolved animals,
aquatic-evolved animals have been unable to manufacture or use tools and
products on their own, so their evolutionary process has been extremely
lengthy, with some never evolving into advanced intelligent beings.
Especially on planets completely covered by water, without the
intervention of advanced extraterrestrials to take them away, aquatic
life forms, despite being highly intelligent and having superior
physical functions after evolving in water for billions of years, still
remain at a stage where they cannot make or use products and tools.
However, the physical advantages of these aquatic-evolved beings, after
millions of years of evolution, are quite astonishing, with their
outstanding physical capabilities being truly breathtaking."</p>
<p>"Look at humans on Earth. Despite your intelligence, your skin,
muscles, and skeletal structure are all subpar, with many suffering from
chronic diseases. In the population over 50 years old, almost everyone
has a chronic illness, with some being tormented by these conditions
long-term without a solution.</p>
<p>Thus, while terrestrial-evolved humans can manufacture and use tools
and products, your own physical evolution is not superior. In contrast,
aquatic-evolved animals have highly optimized body structures, with many
superior traits that terrestrial-evolved beings cannot match.</p>
<p>In the universe, there are numerous planets where intelligent beings
evolved from aquatic life and can also create tools and products,
possess scientific knowledge, and ultimately control and dominate their
entire planet and star system.</p>
<p>So, how do aquatic-evolved animals achieve this?</p>
<p>It turns out that aquatic-evolved animals, through millions of years
of evolution, have the ability to split their bodies and possess
powerful parasitic capabilities. They can parasite inside other
organisms to control them, especially terrestrial animals, to achieve
the goal of creating tools and products.</p>
<p>The ability to split their bodies is crucial. Aquatic animals can
divide their bodies into small parts, yet still retain their
characteristics and various information. Being smaller makes it easier
to parasite within larger terrestrial organisms.</p>
<p>Aquatic beings, living in water and supported by buoyancy, can grow
very large, and the size variance within the same species can be vast.
Giants can parasite smaller beings within their bodies.</p>
<p>Of course, their parasitism is sophisticated, not merely consuming
the host’s flesh as food like terrestrial parasites. Their parasitism
often involves sexual elements, offering sexual bribes and immense
pleasure to the host while improving their bodily functions, allowing
for long-term coexistence.</p>
<p>In our planet system, we host many aquatic-evolved intelligent beings
from the sea, almost all introduced from other planets in the universe.
Although they are highly advanced and formidable, even to a terrifying
extent, they were not lucky enough to become the dominators of our star
system, overshadowed by more powerful terrestrial life. They are still
evolving, and who knows, they might become the rulers of our system in
the future.</p>
<p>"These large, intelligent aquatic creatures aim to parasitize smaller
terrestrial beings within their bodies, typically by swallowing you
whole. Then, various fleshly tubes aggressively grow into your body,
providing nutrition while also controlling you, ensuring you remain a
compliant parasite within them.</p>
<p>Some of these large intelligent beings, once they absorb you into
their bodies, are not likely to release you easily. Even if they do let
you go, they might leave a part of their body inside you, continuing the
parasitism. Once absorbed, it becomes challenging to completely free
yourself from them.</p>
<p>The smaller aquatic intelligent creatures usually resort to stealth
and lure tactics. Initially, something tiny approaches you and, once
inside, takes control, making escape nearly impossible. You are
virtually powerless against their grip, destined to be parasitized for
life.</p>
<p>Some are cunning, detaching a tiny part of their body to invade yours
when you’re unaware. This small invader remains connected to the outside
by a thin line. Attempting to remove it forcefully causes intense
internal pain as it then fully burrows into your body.</p>
<p>Some parasitic species resemble gelatinous substances or mimic
liquids, slowly infiltrating your body to take control.</p>
<p>In our planet system, some of our parasitic beings utilize our
advanced technology. We possess the ability to create or modify bodies,
endowing them with the capacity to parasitize other beings or to absorb
other beings into their bodies for parasitism.</p>
<p>Many parasitic beings on various planets in the universe evolved
naturally. Our planet hosts forums for parasitic beings, exchanging
knowledge and techniques, and providing technical and material support
for parasites.</p>
<p>Though our parasites may seem scattered across our star system, they
can actually exchange information and are part of a well-organized
network.</p>
<p>Some of us have dual identities: a normal one and a parasitic one.
Through GMW and GIW, we can switch between senses and memories at
will."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-11---the-reasons-behind-the-peculiar-sexual-behaviors-of-guoker-people">Chapter
11 - The Reasons Behind the Peculiar Sexual Behaviors of Guoker
People</h2>
<p>Norton explained to me the reasons behind some of the Guoker people’s
strangest sexual behaviors.</p>
<p>"On Earth, sex serves dual purposes: reproduction and familial bonds,
or simply for pleasure between partners. To sustain a family and raise
children, material wealth is essential. Thus, earthly relationships
aren’t merely sexual; they involve a partnership in managing resources.
Offering wealth can enhance comfort and sustain relationships. Moreover,
Earthly sexual activities are governed by a plethora of constraints
including morality, law, culture, and traditional practices. For
Earthlings, relationships encompass more than just sex; they include
love, kinship, care, and business partnerships.</p>
<p>“For us Guokers, the meaning of sex is purely for pleasure,
experience, and sensation. Our relationships are devoid of love,
focusing solely on the physical aspect.</p>
<p>“Material resources are inconsequential to us. We don’t procreate, we
don’t die, and our health is guaranteed, eliminating the need for
familial or economic partnerships. We don’t concern ourselves with the
health of others.</p>
<p>“Our lack of moral and legal restrictions often makes our sexual
activities prone to violence. This prevalence of violence is why virtual
sex is popular among us; it allows for an escape from potential harm at
any moment.</p>
<p>“While Earthlings value wealth and power, we Guokers cherish
sensations and experiences, with sexual pleasure being the most
sought-after. This intense focus on sexual experiences is why we are so
devoted to it.</p>
<p>“In a way, the act of an Earthling engaging in sex with a Guoker
might seem no different from interspecies relations, because for
Guokers, there is only sexual desire without love or emotional
connection.”</p>
<p>“In our planet, sexual behavior between humans and animals, also
known as interspecies sexual behavior, is quite common. This might seem
like a terrible thing to you."</p>
<p>Norton’s final words made me recall Suldair’s remarks about Earth men
engaging in sexual acts with sows and cows, stirring an unsettling
feeling within me.</p>
<p>Norton continued on parasite sex: "On our planet Guoker, parasitic
relationships, particularly the sexual interactions between parasites
and their hosts, are extremely cruel. On Earth, parasites feed on their
hosts’ bodies for sustenance. However, on Guoker, material resources and
food are trivial for all species due to our highly advanced technology,
which makes acquiring these resources far easier than on Earth, where
people still compete over material goods, food, and energy—conflicts
that can lead to fatal outcomes.</p>
<p>Despite our advancements, we Guokers still possess the primal genes
of billions of years of animalistic conflict, but now, instead of
competing for material wealth, the struggle has shifted to a parasitic
battle for control over the bodies of the opposite sex. In other words,
it has shifted to a war between men and women.</p>
<p>For parasitic beings, this struggle is equally ruthless, focused on
dominating and controlling another’s body to turn them into sexual
slaves, rather than destroying them.</p>
<p>Our technology has empowered parasites with bizarre and powerful
capabilities, making them more perverse. Unlike Earthlings, who value
love, Guokers have devolved in this respect. Our approach to sex has
become aggressive, invasive, and characterized by violence, cruelty, and
strangeness that would certainly be deemed psychopathic by Earth
standards.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-12---norton-on-the-origin-of-all-life-in-the-universe">Chapter
12 - Norton on the Origin of All Life in the Universe</h2>
<p>I once asked Norton: "How did we, the people of Earth, come into
existence? Many of us say God created us, but I don’t quite believe
that. Given your advanced technology, I’m more inclined to believe that
you might have created us."</p>
<p>Norton said: "Our current technology is indeed capable of creating
life; our bodies, for example, are self-manufactured and not a product
of natural reproduction. However, we weren’t always able to create our
own bodies. Earthlings, us Guoker people, and other intelligent beings
across the universe, the vast majority of life on any inhabited, living
planet, didn’t spread from other planets nor were they made by some
entity.</p>
<p>In the universe, primitive planets harboring life typically saw
beings evolve from simpler forms. Earthlings weren’t created by gods or
deities; you evolved from simpler life forms. The concept of God and
other deities are figments—creations of human belief.</p>
<p>Now, we possess the technology to engineer life, from simple
organisms to complex beings, including ourselves. This capability was
acquired as our technological advancements reached a certain
threshold.</p>
<p>Every living thing on Earth originated from a lightning strike a
billion years ago, which is symbolically represented by the ten-month
human gestation period. The lightning reacted with nitrogen in the
atmosphere, creating complex molecules that, once in water, formed
simple amino acids and proteins. These compounds became some of the
earliest self-replicating viruses, which then evolved step by step into
more complex organisms.</p>
<p>In the universe, all advanced organisms and civilizations are
survivors of viral exterminations. In a sea of viruses, evolving into a
more advanced life form is perilous. Even those that manage to evolve
are often driven to revert to simpler, viral forms, due to survival
pressures. This results in a tiny fraction of planets with simple viral
life ever developing advanced beings and civilizations, because simpler
structures generally have an evolutionary advantage.</p>
<p>Most scientists on Earth believe humans evolved from primates, which
came from reptiles, themselves evolved from amphibians, originating from
marine life. This isn’t entirely accurate. The earliest life sparked by
lightning began in small bodies of land water like ponds and ditches,
not the oceans, which were inhospitable due to high salt and mineral
content and turbulent conditions.</p>
<p>Early, more advanced life forms thrived in freshwater environments on
land, eventually evolving into various species of fish. Many marine
organisms originated from these freshwater species, gradually adapting
to oceanic conditions. The migration from freshwater to the ocean was
continual, with some species successfully adapting while others died
out. In contrast, transitions from the ocean back to freshwater proved
much more challenging. Evolution tends to occur more rapidly in
freshwater environments due to more stable conditions.</p>
<p>Initially, there was no distinction between plants and animals; early
microbial life forms, resembling viruses, began to diverge into these
categories to survive and adapt to their environments. Occasionally,
more complex organisms would regress to simpler forms to cope with
environmental challenges, leading to genetic and structural
simplifications."</p>
<p>"How did freshwater fish evolve to live on land?”</p>
<p>"Sometimes, heavy rains would cause rivers and lakes to swell,
allowing fish to swim freely into newly formed ponds. As the rainy
season ended and dry conditions returned, these ponds gradually dried
up, leading many fish to perish. However, a few small fish managed to
survive in the scant water at the center of these ponds, enduring until
the next rainy season when they could return to larger bodies of water.
Over millions of years, this cycle repeated, enabling some fish species
to develop a tolerance for drought conditions and even survive periods
without water. For example, on Earth, the snakehead can survive several
days without water. It eventually evolved into creatures like the
mudfish, which can live for months without water, and then into the
ricefield eel, capable of surviving up to a year. Ultimately, the
ricefield eel evolved into snakes, which can live entirely apart from
water. Snakes evolved into tortoises, which shed their shells to become
creatures like rabbits. Rabbits evolved into primates, and primates
eventually evolved into humans.</p>
<p>You Earthlings have tails when your embryos first form, but these
later disappear. Actually, this tail serves to demonstrate that humans
evolved from fish.</p>
<p>The evolution of eyes also took place over a long period. Early life
forms could sense the heat of the sun and determine the direction of
sunlight, which enabled them to navigate. Over eons, these organisms
developed eyes capable of perceiving the universe through the reflection
of light. Today, some animals, including humans, can sense not only
light, sound, heat, electricity, and magnetic fields, but also more
abstract concepts like spatial fields, spacetime acceleration, and even
future information stored in space.</p>
<p>The consciousness of both you Earthlings and us Guoke people is a
form of movement of electrically charged particles in the human brain,
essentially pertaining to information. Simple organisms evolving into
more advanced beings constantly need to control their behavior. As
organisms evolve, controlling their actions becomes increasingly
complex, and over millions of years of evolution, this control has
gradually led to the development of consciousness.</p>
<p>A fundamental trait of living organisms is to avoid harm and seek
benefit. For instance, when faced with harm, like an animal attempting
to eat them, they must quickly move away; when encountering something
beneficial, like food, they should approach. Early life forms could only
simply flee or approach, so this control was straightforward—just
managing forward and backward movement, and the corresponding
consciousness was equally simple.</p>
<p>Later, as organisms evolved to become more complex, they developed
the ability to respond to stimuli such as sound, light, temperature,
odors, physical contact, and acceleration. This led to the creation of
many sensory systems and, consequently, many control systems. The human
body processes signals collected by the sensory systems, fine-tunes
these signals, and then feeds them back to various parts of the body to
control and coordinate the corresponding actions. Thus, consciousness
became very complex.</p>
<p>Due to this complexity, consciousness further evolved a specialized
form of consciousness dedicated to controlling and regulating itself.
From early simple organisms to modern complex humans, consciousness has
always been generated by the movement of electrons and ions within
organisms. Although the carriers of consciousness—electrons and
ions—have not changed much, their environment—the brains and bodies of
organisms—has undergone significant changes over hundreds of millions of
years of evolution. Accordingly, the form of movement that controls
consciousness has also become increasingly complex and
sophisticated.</p>
<p>However, some organisms have evolved towards simplicity, such as some
viruses becoming simpler. Sometimes, choosing a simpler evolutionary
path can be more advantageous for survival. Consciousness evolves
alongside life, and just like life, consciousness is a product of
biological evolution."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-13---are-there-many-populated-planets-in-the-universe">Chapter
13 - Are There Many Populated Planets in the Universe?</h2>
<p>I once asked Norton about the variety of alien species in the
universe.</p>
<p>Norton replied, “The universe appears as the center of an endlessly
vast space, housing a considerable but finite number of planets. This
has been our long-standing belief and the diagrams of the universe we
have drawn reflect this view. Moreover, many intelligent species on
various planets throughout the universe share this perspective. However,
as our scientific technology and observational methods improved, one day
we made a groundbreaking discovery of new planets trillions of
light-years away, shattering our steadfast views of the universe. Now,
we must acknowledge that the universe is layered, much like an onion on
your Earth. Through discoveries in other fields, we can conclude that
the universes space is infinite. Whether the number of planets is also
infinite remains undetermined, as this answer depends on the level of
our observational capabilities. But we already know from other sources
that it is indeed infinite.</p>
<p>In the universe, there are many planets with life, yet the vast
majority are barren and devoid of life. Among those with life, planets
harboring intelligent beings like those on Earth are exceedingly rare,
roughly one in tens of thousands. Most life-bearing planets are in
primitive stages of evolution. For instance, our planet Guoker, which
has developed the technology to build lightspeed spaceships capable of
traveling across the universe, is among the rarest, approximately one in
a hundred million. There are even more advanced planets than ours.</p>
<p>However, from what we understand, the number of planets in the
universe is astoundingly vast, so much so that it is terrifying. There
are a significant number of planets with civilizations far more advanced
than ours, not just one or two. When a civilization develops the
capability to build lightspeed spaceships, it can undertake large-scale
interstellar travel. The presence of a lightspeed spaceship is a crucial
hallmark of a universe civilization.</p>
<p>Therefore, habitable planets in the universe can be broadly
categorized into two types. One includes those that have deciphered the
fundamental cosmic questions of time, space, field, mass, electric
charge, energy, and force—without which the construction of a lightspeed
spaceship would be impossible. These advanced civilizations possess the
knowledge to build and operate lightspeed spaceships, enabling extensive
interstellar travel. The other type comprises those without lightspeed
spaceships, marking them as less advanced civilizations.”</p>
<p>A planet with inhabitants that has developed lightspeed spacecraft
undergoes thousands of years of further technological development,
earning the designation of a thousand-year civilization. Our planet
falls into this category. A planet that continues to develop for over
ten thousand years after inventing lightspeed spacecraft is termed a
ten-thousand-year civilization. A planet that evolves technologically
for over a billion years following such an invention is classified as a
billion-year civilization. This level is exceedingly rare in the
universe.</p>
<p>Another criterion we use to gauge advancement is the degree of
virtualization. On a planet, the greater the proportion of virtual
products utilized by its inhabitants, the more developed it is
considered. A planet where everything, including computers for
processing information, human bodies, buildings, transportation
vehicles, and industrial manufacturing, is virtualized to nearly 100%
represents an extremely advanced civilization. A civilization achieving
50% virtualization is also considered highly advanced. Compared to most
inhabited planets in the universe, which have lower technological levels
than Earth, you Earthlings are still relatively backward."</p>
<p>Suldair added: "In the universe, there is an unwritten natural rule:
any backward planet incapable of interstellar travel is covertly
overseen and monitored by one or several advanced civilizations. This
serves two purposes: to prevent other advanced civilizations from
excessively meddling in the affairs of the backward planet, and to avert
internal conflicts on the planet, especially catastrophic wars like
nuclear wars, which could completely destroy it.</p>
<p>Such interference generally involves remotely altering the thought
processes of key individuals on the backward planet, rather than
deploying physical resources or personnel. For instance, during World
War II, although Germany initially mastered the technology to develop
atomic bombs, they were thwarted by extraterrestrial intervention.
According to the standards mentioned earlier, Earth is considered
technologically backward because you have not developed lightspeed
flying saucers and are restricted to travel within your own Solar
System. The principle of motion on Earth is governed by the conservation
of momentum, where momentum equals mass times velocity. Our lightspeed
spaceships also adhere to the conservation of momentum, but our momentum
formula incorporates the vector of lightspeed minus the object’s
velocity, multiplied by mass.</p>
<p>Aliens with technology developed over millions or billions of years
have already surpassed these conventional principles of movement. They
can overcome the limitations of space and time without any accidents.
For us, finding a third type of natural motion beyond the two known
forms of momentum conservation is not an easy task. We are certain that
at least a third and possibly even a fourth type of motion exists in
nature, and one of our primary objectives is to discover this third
type.”</p>
<p>"Indeed, the universe encompasses endless possibilities. Anything you
can conceive of can be realized, and even the inconceivable may come to
fruition. However, what you truly need to do is find a pathway to make
these possibilities a reality. You require a tangible stepping stone;
otherwise, you’ll find yourself back at the starting point, having
gained nothing," said Norton. "Civilizations that have existed for
millions of years have had limited contact with us and do not share
their scientific and technological knowledge. They are also highly
virtualized, even more so than us. Their scientific and technological
prowess, especially in mathematics, is so advanced it could figuratively
suffocate us.</p>
<p>They have engineered a metallic liquid that can control and modify
human consciousness. Similarly, we have developed this metallic
substance, which can infiltrate the bodies of humans on Earth and
quickly alter or erase their consciousness. The physical appearance of
the person remains unchanged, yet their consciousness is replaced with
that of a Guoker, effectively transforming the Earthling into one of us.
This metallic liquid is programmed in advance to be controlled by a set
of mathematical codes, which we are unable to decipher. Even if they
were to provide us with these codes, we would remain perplexed for an
extended period. However, if we were to share our simplest codes with
you Earthlings, you would not understand them for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Despite our efforts to gather all the top mathematical minds globally
to craft sophisticated codes, they can easily break them, highlighting
the vast gap in capabilities between us. Advanced civilizations engage
in a silent mathematical contest, which may seem alien to you since
Earthlings typically engage in more physical forms of warfare.</p>
<p>For example, your struggle against viruses involves exhaustive
efforts with minimal success. We approach the problem differently, using
mathematics to predict and calculate all viruses, including those not
yet present on Earth. This demonstrates the power of mathematics. The
issue with Earth’s approach is a failure to recognize that a virus is
fundamentally an information problem, with information being a form of
matter and space movement. Without this understanding, you won’t
consider mathematical solutions.</p>
<p>In our development and manufacturing of human bodies, we also rely
heavily on mathematical calculations, requiring advanced mathematical
tools. We use these tools to scan hidden information in space, creating
forecasts for the future.</p>
<p>As for the few civilizations that have existed for billions of years,
they avoid direct contact and do not share their technology with us. We
know very little about them and would not dare provoke them. We maintain
a dedicated monitoring system for Earth, and should any beings from a
billion-year-old civilization visit, we would swiftly intervene. We
suspect that the ‘floating person’ you encountered as a child herding
geese belonged to a highly advanced civilization, potentially one that
has existed for billions of years. In that moment of contact, you may
have been infused with their consciousness, gaining access to memories
not your own. Our primary reason for bringing you to our planet is to
gain a different perspective on the universe through you.
Hierarchically, we fear those from million-year civilizations just as
they fear those from billion-year civilizations. For us, a being from a
billion-year civilization is akin to a deity standing before you,"
explained Suldair.</p>
<p>"We abduct beings from across the universe. For those from
civilizations as advanced as ours, we ensure they are returned to avoid
retaliation. However, with less advanced planets like Earth, sometimes
we’re too lazy to send people back. Yes, I can be quite lazy," Suldair
chuckled unnaturally.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-14-religion-on-guoker-planet">Chapter 14 – Religion on
Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>Once I chatted about religion with Norton, Suldair and Willie.</p>
<p>I said: "Religion significantly influences us on Earth. Our primary
religions include Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam. Are there gods,
Buddhas, or divine entities in the universe? If so, where might they
reside? Does your planet, Guoker, have any religions? If yes, what kinds
are they, and how influential are they on your society?"</p>
<p>Suldair replied decisively, “There are no gods or Buddhas in the
universe. Those are mere fabrications by you Earthlings. We do not have
any religion on Guoker.”</p>
<p>Norton added, “While our planet was not technologically advanced in
its early days, we did have religions for a long period. Nowadays,
religion has been marginalized on our planet, nearly fading away
completely. It’s seldom mentioned and exists only in our history and
memory.” “Science and religion both stem from human cognition—science
from rational inquiry and religion from intuitive belief. Science arises
from curiosity about the unknown, while religion originates from fear of
it. In the primitive and undeveloped times of Guoker, just as with early
Earth, people felt terrorized and powerless in the face of natural
disasters such as thunderstorms, floods, hurricanes, volcanoes,
earthquakes, as well as the inevitabilities of disease, aging, and
death. Facing the brutal attacks and slaughter from their own kind, they
felt too weak to control their destinies, leading to fear and
helplessness. In these times, they invented omnipotent gods for
protection and comfort, thus giving birth to religion. In those
primitive societies, people’s understanding of nature was minimal and
superficial, leading to a pervasive fear of the natural world, where the
power of religion was strong and the presence of science, weak.</p>
<p>Religion is a cognition generated by fear and helplessness. In the
beginning of Earth human history, religion wasn’t differentiated from
science. Later as Earth humans developed their cognition deeper and
broader in variety, science was separated from religion and developed in
the opposite direction. As people knew better about Nature, science
became increasingly powerful as scientific cognition grew deeper and
broader in scope, and religion was constantly weakened with religious
cognition shrinking its scope. The explanations of the world, the
Universe, life and society by religion were increasingly childish and
ridiculous to people, whereas logic, definition and quantitative
analysis from science grew increasingly convincing for them.</p>
<p>We have cracked the mystery of the core of the Universe - space.
Immediately, the Universe revealed all its core secrets. As we knew
better about the essence of space, time and field, we now fully control
the core secrets of the universe, and any sense of awe towards the
mysterious universe has completely disappeared among us. It can be said
that as long as there is death, religion will not cease to exist.
However, we have mastered the technology of immortality; our people no
longer face the fear of death and completely control their own
destinies. This is the key factor behind the disappearance of religion
on our planet and is also the major trend in the development of all
planets with intelligent beings throughout the universe—a trend that is
irreversible. The futures of our planet and yours are the same.</p>
<p>Some people believe that highly advanced planets in the universe have
powerful religions capable of controlling people’s thoughts and
restraining their behavior. However, such claims are unreliable. Our
observations of many highly civilized planets across the universe have
shown that on highly advanced planets, where science is extremely
developed, the influence of religion is negligible. There is no
concurrent development of science and religion; they are contradictory
and oppositional.</p>
<p>On planets like Guoker, which boast highly advanced technology,
people can create their own bodies, achieve immortality, and even
replace their physical forms with light, becoming virtual entities. We
can cure any disease instantaneously. These planets possess powerful
scientific and technological capabilities. With such advancements, the
need for physical and mental labor is largely replaced by artificial
intelligence, making the acquisition of material wealth and energy
incredibly easy. People have no need to compete for materials, wealth,
or energy. Advanced planets can satisfy all human desires, both noble
and nefarious, through their formidable scientific and technological
prowess, eliminating the need for moral, legal, or religious
constraints.</p>
<p>On Earth, people are encouraged to fulfill their normal desires
through labor and technology, while only moral, legal, and religious
systems can curb their malevolent impulses. For instance, if an adult
male desires to molest a young girl on Earth, this impulse is restrained
through morality, law, and religion. In contrast, on our planet, highly
realistic virtual sex games have been developed to fulfill such desires
without distinction from reality, as perceived by all sensory organs. We
also have various other hyper-realistic virtual reality games, including
regal and combat simulations, that cater to a wide array of desires,
both benign and malevolent.</p>
<p>Our ability to convert one substance into another effortlessly with
artificial field technology means that on our planet, precious metals
and jewels, which are highly valued on Earth, are as common as dirt and
worthless. Thus, there is no conflict over such commodities, a stark
contrast to Earth. Earth relies on moral and legal systems to regulate
both normal and evil human desires due to limited resources and energy,
which cannot satisfy everyone’s whims. When these systems fail, religion
often steps in to restrain both good and evil impulses. On our planet,
however, advanced technology is used to fulfill desires, not to restrain
them, rendering religion utterly obsolete in curbing evil impulses.</p>
<p>Understanding the universe and nature, we can grasp the profound
mysteries of the cosmos and control our destinies. We harbor no fear of
death or disease, no worries about illness, no need to struggle for
material wealth, and no fear of brutal conflicts among ourselves. The
fundamental conditions that give rise to religion—fear, and its function
to suppress desires—are completely absent on our planet, explaining why
religion is thoroughly marginalized and seldom mentioned.</p>
<p>Historically, the power of religion on Earth has been strong and
enduring, accompanying and influencing humanity since the dawn of
primitive society. However, on Earth, the influence of religion is
waning, and the future does not foresee influential religious leaders
who could sway the thoughts of Earth’s people. The impact of religious
leaders has diminished, and people have lost interest in them, no longer
venerating them excessively. Instead, they regard scientific luminaries
almost as deities, due to the extensive knowledge accumulated about the
natural world. The future will likely see significant scientific
discoveries and great scientists as the most influential forces on
Earth. It can be predicted that religion will increasingly be
marginalized and replaced by science, as science demonstrates its power
more profoundly.</p>
<p>Another function of religion is to resolve confusion, which will also
be overtaken by science, as our understanding has revealed all the
secrets of the universe, leaving the superficial, naive, and intuitively
derived explanations of religion believed by no one."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-15---first-time-being-examined-and-experimented">Chapter
15 - First Time Being Examined and Experimented</h2>
<p>Once, Norton, Suldair, and Willie led me into a room where two
individuals, possibly robots, awaited us. At the center of the room
stood a narrow bed, barely wide enough for one person, its end elevated,
draped in white cloth.</p>
<p>Norton stated solemnly, "We are going to examine your body now. Trust
in our technology; you won’t experience any pain or discomfort. Please
lie down on this bed."</p>
<p>Obeying Norton’s command, I lay down, my heart pounding with fear,
imagining my body being dismembered and cut into pieces. Suddenly, the
room plunged into darkness. I felt as though my body split in two; one
part of me floated in the air, watching the other part lying on the bed.
Was this an image provided by the GIW?</p>
<p>At the head and foot of the bed stood a figure each. Soon, one of
them took a thin, square blade and made a square incision in my throat,
then seemingly brushed the cut gently with something feather-like. I
felt no pain, only a ticklish sensation.</p>
<p>The translator Kevin from the GIW interpreted their words, indicating
a problem with my throat that would plague me for life. Indeed, I
developed chronic pharyngitis in my twenties, which has caused incessant
pain and frequent flare-ups to this day. Despite spending a lot of money
on treatments, I’ve been frequently deceived with no relief, enduring
ongoing agony.</p>
<p>When the lights returned, the version of me that had floated merged
back with the one on the bed. Relieved from not experiencing the
imagined dismemberment, I was overwhelmed with excitement and my anxiety
eased. I saw Norton and sat up. Through the translator, Norton inquired,
"Do you feel anything at the junction between your abdomen and
thighs?"</p>
<p>"It felt like a snake—cold and slithering," I replied.</p>
<p>"Where did it go afterward?" Norton asked, tilting his head and
staring at me for a moment before leaving without waiting for my
response.</p>
<p>The thought of a cold snake possibly inside my body frightened me
again, turning my recently relieved mood somber and nauseous.</p>
<p>Similar examinations and experiments occurred many times thereafter.
On a few occasions, I felt not just snakes but also tentacle-like tubes
and leeches invading my body. Once, I felt transformed into a white
skeleton, experiencing an extreme dryness and heat throughout my
body.</p>
<p>"Who is that?" I asked..</p>
<p>"It’s you." GIW servant Kevin answered.</p>
<p>"How can that be me?" No further answers were provided, and I was
left bewildered. Fortunately, like the end of a nightmare, I soon
regained clarity, and the experiment concluded, restoring normalcy.</p>
<p>Some experiments were particularly draining, especially those
involving thick tubes entering through my anus, as thick as my own
calves, forcibly threading through my body. After such severe physical
depletion, I would fall into a deep, death-like sleep, awakening
drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>On several occasions, I felt as if I was falling from a great height,
plummeting to the ground where countless bright steel needles awaited.
Upon impact, the needles pierced through my abdomen, causing a sudden,
immense pain that immediately knocked me unconscious.</p>
<p>Norton explained that this was a simulation; the needles hadnt
actually penetrated my abdomen. This was done to test how many needles I
could endure piercing my abdomen, because the females of the Gokkians
have flesh tubes inside their bodies, which could potentially pierce my
abdomen during sexual intercourse with them. The purpose of testing my
tolerance was to ensure that their sexual activities could be terminated
in time before I might die.</p>
<p>Nortons explanation instilled in me a profound fear and concern
towards their females.</p>
<p>Sometimes during the experiments, I would sleep so deeply that my
legs, remaining in one position for too long, would become sore upon
waking. When I thought about this, it seemed as if they could read my
mind; afterward, they often placed something under my knees for
support.</p>
<p>After numerous experiments, I also developed some techniques. As
sleep approached, I would try to arrange myself in a comfortable
sleeping position to avoid discomfort upon waking.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-16---guoker-people-behave-indulgingly">Chapter 16 -
Guoker People Behave Indulgingly</h2>
<p>During my time on the planet, I observed that the Guoker people
displayed highly indulgent behavior, particularly in sexual matters. It
was common to see individuals completely naked, with some engaging in
sexual activities openly in public. This was especially prevalent in
dimly-lit environments such as underwater and underground cave worlds.
Their clothing tended to be minimal, sometimes appearing and
disappearing intermittently, and some were outright without any.
Additionally, their skin color underwent significant changes, typically
becoming extremely vivid and bright or shimmering with various
luminescent hues.</p>
<p>On one occasion, while outdoors with Willie, Suldair, and Norton, I
observed six Guoker women seated on the ground. Upon noticing our
presence, they rose excitedly, gesturing and posing provocatively.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one woman’s clothing vanished, followed swiftly by the
others, leaving them all exposed in the bright light, their bodies
radiant and colorful.</p>
<p>Some of the women displayed protrusions resembling thin, shiny
appendages extending from their lower bodies, reminiscent of Hawaiian
hula skirts.</p>
<p>Others appeared to levitate, positioning themselves above me with
legs parted, revealing a distinct anatomy. Their bodies emitted dazzling
lights, shifting in color and intensity, as they contorted in suggestive
movements, seemingly intent on seduction.</p>
<p>Shocked by their behavior, I remarked, "Such shameless behavior would
warrant police intervention on Earth," though I found myself unable to
resist the allure.</p>
<p>"It’s no surprise," chimed in Kevin, the GIW servant, in my ear.
"Guoker Planet is renowned for its licentiousness."</p>
<p>Observing Norton and his companions’ nonchalant response, I inquired
about their perception. They claimed to see the women fully clothed,
oblivious to any indecent behavior.</p>
<p>"It’s possible they’ve selectively screened us," suggested Willie.
"Perhaps they’ve requested GMW and GIW to present their true nudity and
actions solely to you, Brother Qian. What we witnessed may have been
fabricated, or simply snapshots of their past behavior. Only you
witnessed the reality."</p>
<p>"I find your Guoker people lack self-discipline, morality, and shame.
I’ve observed instances of public nudity without repercussion, which is
concerning. On Earth, we believe that technological advancement should
coincide with moral progress. A society’s moral standards should match
its technological prowess. How can a highly advanced civilization like
yours exhibit such behavior?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We Guoker people don’t adhere to moral codes or laws," Norton
answered.</p>
<p>Had Suldair uttered those words, I might have dismissed them as jest.
However, Norton’s sincerity surprised me. He proceeded to explain their
perspective.</p>
<p>"The advancement of technology serves to fulfill human desires, both
noble and base. Desire propels both technological and societal progress.
These desires encompass the spectrum of human inclinations, from the
virtuous to the malevolent. For instance, on Earth, the act of sexually
assaulting a minor is universally condemned by law and morality.
Similarly, on our planet in its early stages, such acts were likewise
prohibited. However, the existence of these dark desires persists
regardless of legal or moral deterrents.</p>
<p>Hence, we’ve developed numerous virtual intimacy technologies to
cater to these darker desires. These virtual intimacy games are so
lifelike that individuals may not discern their artificial nature
without external indication. For instance, the desire to commit homicide
is an impossibility on Guoker Planet. Our global monitoring systems, GMW
and GIW, detect any inclination toward such actions and intervene to
prevent harm. Thus, the notion of carrying out such acts is
inconceivable to us. However, individuals may explore such inclinations
within virtual simulations.</p>
<p>Let me make another example. Killing others is impossible on Guoker
Planet. GMW and GIW can detect any trend of intention of killing others,
and separate the two to prevent harm. That makes us never think about
killing others, because we know it’s impossible and it’s utterly stupid.
But you can do that in a virtual game instead.</p>
<p>Our approach to technological development addresses the full spectrum
of human desires, without relying solely on moral or legal constraints.
Consequently, while our technological prowess is advanced, our moral
standards may not necessarily align. The presumption that advanced
civilizations inherently possess high morality is merely conjecture from
the perspective of Earthlings.</p>
<p>While we do have laws, their application is not directed toward
individual constraint. Instead, our laws govern organizations,
artificial intelligence, algorithms, and similar entities. This approach
is bolstered by the vigilant oversight of GMW and GIW, which ensure the
protection of all individuals on our planet. Thus, the capacity for
individuals to inflict harm upon others is effectively neutralized
without the aid of organized efforts and advanced algorithms.</p>
<p>Only one out of every ten thousand of us has a job, and it’s
incredibly easy. Playing is the essence of our existence. We boast
numerous gaming venues featuring hyper-realistic virtual games that blur
the lines between reality and simulation. Whether it’s embarking on
virtual journeys or ruling kingdoms in elaborate simulations, our
entertainment options are boundless. Fancy interstellar exploration?
Conquering alien worlds or engaging in cerebral battles with
half-insect, half-human adversaries? Escaping the snares of seductive
yet deadly creatures? We’ve crafted games to cater to every conceivable
desire, offering endless amusement without conclusion.</p>
<p>However, treasure-hunting games are virtually non-existent here. Our
ability to effortlessly transmute one substance into another has
rendered Earth’s treasures obsolete. Gold and jewels hold no allure;
they’re mere trinkets to us. Rather than relying on ethical or legal
constraints, we harness technological advancements to indulge in both
virtuous and malevolent whims. On our planet, laws and morals hold no
sway.</p>
<p>In civilizations lagging in technological advancement, desires are
often deemed sinister due to scarce resources. Yet, as technology
progresses, such desires become normalized. Religion, once a moral
compass, now wields negligible influence.</p>
<p>While Earth celebrates love and kindness, our society exalts in
wickedness and violence. This inclination towards remote virtual
intimacy arises from the inherent violence in our physical relations,
offering the control to terminate encounters at will.</p>
<p>But true malevolence and violence require innovation. Merely
harboring evil intentions won’t suffice; realizing them demands
ingenuity. Our society may appear diametrically opposed to Earth’s, but
understanding this requires firsthand experience—particularly in matters
of sexuality.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-17---my-alien-girlfriend">Chapter 17 - My Alien
Girlfriend</h2>
<p>Once, Suldair suggested we go out for some nighttime fun. Both Willie
and Norton were on board, and naturally, I was keen to join. Norton
proposed bringing our girlfriends along, dialing his ear—likely sending
a message via the GlW to his girlfriend—and sure enough, a stunning
woman suddenly appeared before us.</p>
<p>From behind, she resembled Willie in height and stature, but
face-to-face, she was strikingly beautiful and refined, with every
feature delicately crafted, more composed than Willie. Her black hair,
adorned with dazzling ribbons, cascaded in two soft strands beside her
ears. Her large eyes and pointed chin bore a resemblance to cartoon
characters from Earth. Dressed—or rather, projected—in a minimalist yet
alluring ensemble, she sported a silver-white crop top above a black
microskirt. The skirt, made of numerous soft strands, shimmered with a
metallic sheen, offering fleeting glimpses of her milky skin as she
moved.</p>
<p>Approaching me, she examined my eyes with scrutiny. Her sheer allure
and my nakedness made me instinctively step back. She spoke, and Kevin
relayed her words: "You’re Brother Qian from Earth, aren’t you? Quite
handsome, just a tad tall. May I touch you?"</p>
<p>"Of course," I replied, though inwardly anxious about where she might
touch. Thankfully, she began with my hand before gently caressing my
cheek. It was my first encounter with Guoker skin, smooth yet chillingly
rigid compared to Earth’s warmth, a sensation that left me
intrigued.</p>
<p>"That feels different," remarked Norton’s girlfriend, visibly
excited. "Earthlings have warm skin."</p>
<p>Norton and Suldair both wore smiles, while Willie appeared less than
pleased. Suldair, unwilling to be outdone, also held his ear and
messaged his girlfriend. Before long, she appeared before us.</p>
<p>Suldair’s girlfriend bore a resemblance to both Willie and Norton’s
partners, but with an added allure. Her eyes gleamed like diamonds, and
the skin around them had a metallic sheen, transitioning gradually from
pale pink to a metallic gray before turning completely black around the
eye sockets. This gave her a ghostly and sinister appearance, yet
undeniably captivating and natural, exuding a powerful charm.</p>
<p>She sported a tight black leather tank top fused with a shiny black
miniskirt, accentuating her voluptuous figure.</p>
<p>Looping her arm around Suldair’s waist, she gazed at me with a hint
of disdain and whispered to Suldair. Instantly, Kevin relayed her words:
"Is this big fellow from Earth? He’s quite the giant, isn’t he? Are
humans all foolish?"</p>
<p>"No, he’s quite smart." Suldair answered.</p>
<p>"Shall we go?" Norton said.</p>
<p>"What about your boyfriend, Willie?" I asked.</p>
<p>Willie huffed in response, ignoring me. Instead, she closed her eyes,
tilted her chin upward, and gave a slight nod.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand. "You haven’t one?"</p>
<p>"You are her boyfriend!" Suldair said, "Didn’t we promise to arrange
you a girlfriend? It’s her."</p>
<p>"Wow really? So I’m your boyfriend and you’re my girlfriend now?" I
asked Willie.</p>
<p>"No you’re not. You’re my prey." Willie was proud like a peacock.</p>
<p>"What? You want to eat me?" I was perplexed by Willie’s words.</p>
<p>"Ha-ha!" Suldair chuckled. "That’s a poor translation. She means
you’re her toy."</p>
<p>"No, it should be translated as ‘you’re my pet’ to avoid
misunderstanding," Norton interjected. "During Brother Qian’s time here
on our planet, we’ve arranged Willie to be his girlfriend."</p>
<p>"Don’t worry, Willie won’t devour you," Suldair added cryptically.
"She’ll treat you well. You’ll understand her gentleness."</p>
<p>"Let’s go!" Norton motioned with his hand, a gesture similar to how
we signal walking on Earth. And so, the six of us stepped out.</p>
<p>Norton and Suldair both had their arms wrapped around their
girlfriends’ waists, displaying affection. I lacked the confidence to
embrace Willie or even hold her hand. Despite being particularly eager
for intimacy at that moment, I hesitated to make physical contact with a
woman. Moreover, being naked made me feel self-conscious. It seemed
Willie wasn’t inclined to hold my hand either, so I trailed behind her
alongside Norton and Suldair as we strolled through the streets.</p>
<p>The cityscape of Guoker Planet sparkled with vibrant lights at night,
resembling a bustling metropolis on Earth. However, what distinguished
it were the towering virtual buildings suspended in the sky,
disconnected from the ground. These colossal virtual structures featured
various Guoker script and intricate patterns, appearing to hover in
mid-air—a testament to Guoker’s advanced virtual imaging technology.</p>
<p>As I followed them, I wondered what kind of entertainment they could
have since they didn’t eat or drink and probably didn’t frequent
bars.</p>
<p>We arrived at a colossal building and entered through its gates.
Inside, the atmosphere was lively and noisy, akin to an Earthly
nightclub. I observed many Guoker individuals arranged in two rows
around a lengthy, glass-like rectangular counter, approximately 2 meters
wide and seemingly endless in length. The counter was filled with water,
within which danced numerous diminutive figures. Those outside the
counter were also moving in synchrony with the rhythm.</p>
<p>"Are these miniature figures created using holographic technology?" I
inquired of Norton.</p>
<p>"No, you’re mistaken this time. These are real people," Norton
corrected me.</p>
<p>"Do you have individuals much smaller in size on Guoker?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Our heights are uniform among Guoker people. This effect is achieved
through artificial manipulation of spatial perception, creating an
illusion for those inside. If these individuals were to step out, they
would appear similar in height to us. If you doubt it, we can
demonstrate it to you," Norton offered.</p>
<p>Norton instructed his girlfriend to step into the contraption. She
complied and ascended onto a nearby circular platform. Suddenly, a
transparent, glass-like cylinder descended and enclosed her, swiftly
whisked away by a colossal mechanical arm in a fraction of a second.
Norton then pointed to a small figure within the water-filled counter,
claiming it to be his girlfriend. Upon closer inspection, I confirmed it
was indeed her, albeit clad in different attire—tight swimwear. Spotting
us, she waved enthusiastically before joining in the aquatic dance.</p>
<p>"How do they breathe underwater? I didn’t see any breathing
equipment."</p>
<p>"We Guoker people sometimes don’t need to breathe because the
artificial field can provide us with oxygen directly infused into our
bloodstream," Norton explained.</p>
<p>Norton’s girlfriend was clad in revealing swimwear. From behind,
Guoker women appeared similar to Earth women, except with more prominent
hips. However, from the front, they had a cylindrical bulge between
their legs, the nature of which I couldn’t discern at the time. Despite
her swimwear, it obscured this detail, leaving me curious.</p>
<p>As Norton’s girlfriend danced underwater, she swam closer to us. When
she turned around, I caught sight of her hips, and a sudden rush of
desire washed over me—an instinctive, primal urge. Feeling
uncomfortable, I glanced at Norton, who seemed unperturbed. I then
looked to Willie, who wore an inscrutable expression.</p>
<p>Suldair attempted to coax his girlfriend into dancing underwater, but
she declined. Shortly after, Norton’s girlfriend emerged, her swimwear
replaced with her usual attire.</p>
<p>Later, we encountered a large glass enclosure filled with tumbling
blue balloons, each roughly the size of a basketball. Observing people
effortlessly enter through the glass walls, I followed suit. Though I
felt as though my body melded with the glass, I found myself seamlessly
entering the room filled with balloons. Absent of a visible floor, I
descended until the tumbling balloons buoyed me. Their smooth surfaces
exerted a gentle suction on my skin, akin to the caress of a young
woman, a sensation that brought immense satisfaction. I pondered whether
this tactile experience served as a prelude to intimacy with Guoker
women. Among the blue balloons, I soon encountered balloons of varying
colors—green, red, white, pink—and assorted sizes and shapes. Some were
small enough to gently pass through my body, eliciting a subtle,
pleasurable friction from within. It seemed these balloons had the
ability to influence mood, imbuing a sense of happiness. At times, I
felt as though I were immersed in liquid, yet breathing remained
effortless.</p>
<p>Finally, I found myself in a corridor alongside Norton and his
companions. Without exchanging words, we proceeded along the lengthy
passage. Along its sides stood rows of rooms, their transparent walls
showcasing an array of balloons in different shapes and colors—loaves,
sausages, spaghetti, donuts, lotus roots—yet most remained unoccupied. A
sense of waste pervaded the scene.</p>
<p>The corridor’s floor was exquisitely crafted, seemingly metallic and
emitting a soft, eerie blue glow. As we proceeded, towering walls loomed
on either side, shrouded in darkness, while the ceiling above remained
pitch black, devoid of stars—a clear indication we were still
indoors.</p>
<p>The blue light from the floor cast a cyan hue over us all. Norton and
Suldair walked hand in hand with their girlfriends, while I continued to
trail behind Willie.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an object protruded from the dark wall, unleashing a
bright, intense beam of white light that struck Norton, piercing him
through. I was taken aback, yet Norton and Suldair burst into
laughter.</p>
<p>"Don’t worry, it’s just a virtual beam," Norton reassured, but I
couldn’t shake the sight of the gaping hole in Norton’s chest.</p>
<p>Moments later, Suldair cried out as he too fell victim to the virtual
beam. Subsequently, Norton’s and Suldair’s girlfriends, along with
Willie, were also struck. I was the last to be targeted.</p>
<p>We navigated the blue-lit floor, dodging the virtual beams. Despite
our efforts, we were all hit multiple times. Suldair made the most agile
maneuvers but suffered the worst, sporting numerous glowing punctures
across his body.</p>
<p>Upon exiting the blue-lit floor, the glowing punctures on our bodies
vanished instantly.</p>
<p>Further along the corridor, an optical illusion divided us into two
halves, creating a comical yet unsettling scene of fragmented figures
traversing the ground.</p>
<p>As we pressed forward, the terrain became uneven, littered with sharp
knives and gaping chasms. Norton pressed ahead, reassuring us that it
was all part of the virtual simulation, and the ground beneath remained
level.</p>
<p>Moving cautiously at first, we eventually picked up pace.
Interestingly, stepping on the sharp knives elicited the sensation of
them piercing through our feet.</p>
<p>The girls lagged behind, a common occurrence that seemed to transcend
worlds. Norton suggested they close their eyes and simply follow. He
took his girlfriend’s hand, while Suldair raced back to do the same with
his.</p>
<p>I noticed Willie was the last to reach us. Sensing an opportunity, I
reached out my hand to her. After a moment’s hesitation, she took hold
of it.</p>
<p>Her hand felt cold and rigid, with skin firmer yet smoother than that
of an Earthling. It was reminiscent of touching an eel or a dogfish—soft
on the surface but solid underneath, lacking the usual sensation of
bones.</p>
<p>Because the road was winding, the women still stumbled as they
walked. Thus, my hands and body occasionally touched Willie’s body,
which was also cold and extremely smooth, yet not very soft. Contact
with her body made me feel itchy inside, and sexual impulses made it
hard for me to control myself. We continued walking forward, and
suddenly in front of us, there was a descending slope with many steps.
At the first step, there were several poles like the street lamps on the
streets of our Earth. Several Guoker men and women stood embracing under
something similar to a streetlamp, and I was astonished to see the
streetlamp rapidly dripping a transparent glue-like substance onto them,
wrapping a couple into a big sphere and quickly rolling them down the
steps.</p>
<p>Norton, Suldair, and their girlfriends walked without hesitation
under the strange streetlamp, turning into big spheres and rolling down
the steps like bowling balls.</p>
<p>The opportunity came, and I too embraced Willie, standing under the
strange streetlamp. Willie did not resist. Unfortunately, her head only
reached my chest, and I felt that when the transparent liquid was about
to fall, I quickly lifted Willie. She straddled me, riding on my waist,
and was wrapped up by the transparent glue. We hugged tightly and also
rolled down the steps.</p>
<p>Willie was very excited, especially when she was bounced high on the
steps and then heavily fell, she screamed wildly. Holding Willie
tightly, I felt a strong impulse, a primal sexual feeling, feeling that
only by entering her body would I achieve immense pleasure, but I was
wrapped in transparent glue, unable to move, unable to adjust my body
posture.</p>
<p>After the steps ended, we stopped on the ground, and the glue also
gradually melted from our bodies, first falling to the ground, and then
flowing away like water. Suldair and Norton had also disappeared without
a trace, I don’t know where they went. Willie pressed her ear, probably
communicating through the GIW.</p>
<p>‘Willie, where did they go?’ I asked.</p>
<p>‘Never mind them, let’s go back,’ Willie said as she rushed forward
and wrapped her arms around my waist. ‘I just felt something, let’s go
back now, back to my little nest, and continue this feeling, it’s
wonderful, isn’t it?’</p>
<p>Willie raised her left hand and playfully waved it by her ear, and in
a daze, through the GMW, we arrived at Willie’s home. Willie’s home was
also very exquisite, with many furnishings and a lot of round-shaped
furniture. There were some strange plants and flowers, many
semi-transparent curtains hanging in the room, making things look
vaguely visible, reflecting some unique feminine traits. There were no
visible light bulbs in the house, but the light was very soft, seeming
to evenly emit from the overall walls. Willie’s home also had two robots
with dark red bodies, constantly trembling slightly, as if they were
made up of many bustling tiny things.</p>
<p>Willie lay on her side on the virtual bed, looking noble and posing
elegantly. She stared straight at me, beckoning me closer, perhaps
suggesting she wanted me to come to her. What did this mean? Did she
want to engage in physical intimacy?</p>
<p>Excited, I approached her, and indeed she said, “I want you to sport
on my body, but first, I need to feed you some carbohydrates, although
they are solid.”</p>
<p>Willie covered her ears, and shortly after, strips of food appeared
on a table beside me.</p>
<p>There were no utensils like chopsticks or forks; I picked up the food
with my hands and started eating. The taste was delightful, some had a
chewy texture, and some tasted like asparagus.</p>
<p>Earthlings are strange; in unfamiliar environments, they always need
to recognize someone as a relative and base all their actions on this
‘relative.’ Initially, I regarded Norton as such, but now it seemed my
allegiance had shifted to Willie.</p>
<p>After finishing the food, Willie stood before me, ready to proceed. I
thought to myself, having often imagined who would be my first sexual
partner and where it would happen, I never anticipated it would be on an
alien planet and with a non-human.</p>
<p>Willie stood in front of me, and suddenly her upper body’s black
clothing and lower body’s purple clothing vanished, revealing her pale
skin and long, pointed breasts like goat horns, which gave me a
shiver.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/Y5GjrbuyE8WnOSZ.png" width="337" height="449"></p>
<p>Between her legs, there was a gap of about 8 to 9 centimeters,
leading to the base of her thighs where two swollen labia were
prominent, creating a slender vertical crease that extended from the
front up to her lower abdomen and continued a significant length along
her buttocks, far surpassing that of humans on Earth.</p>
<p>On her lower abdomen, the protrusion of the labia was less
noticeable, becoming most prominent at the base of her thighs.</p>
<p>I realized that the bulging part of their lower body was actually
these full labia, unlike the much smaller labia seen in human females on
Earth.</p>
<p>Her entire lower body was exceptionally smooth, matching the color of
the rest of her body perfectly, and devoid of any pubic hair or similar
features.</p>
<p>She had not actually removed any clothing, which was odd at the time.
Her skin then began to change color: from white to a light pink, then to
a pale yellow, followed by a delicate green, then blue, purple, and back
to white. When turning blue, her body emitted a fairly strong pale blue
glow, a phenomenon I would witness many times later.</p>
<p>Her black clothing seemed as if it had grown out of her skin. Were
her clothes and her body fused together? It was unimaginable at the
time. Later, I learned that these were virtual images created by their
GIW and GMW; what I thought were her clothes were just virtual
images.</p>
<p>Guoker people do have real clothes, but often their clothes are
virtual images. If there are no real clothes on their bodies, does
touching them always mean touching their bare skin? Not necessarily, as
they can request various barrier effects from the Global Movement
Network on their bodies, making it feel different from actual skin.</p>
<p>The changes in their skin color and the patterns on their skin are
remotely controlled by the Global Movement Network and Global
Information Network. Their skin, which appears to have a matte
reflection, is also a result of enhancements from these networks. Their
natural skin is a pale pink and is extremely smooth and delicate, far
surpassing the skin of us Earthlings.</p>
<p>Suddenly, many soft, thin tubes extended from Willie’s lower body,
about a hundred in total, sky blue mixed with purple, very vibrant. The
tips of these tubes could form spirals, and the coils were lighter in
color but looked even more vivid, like clusters of flowers around her.
These are the most important sexual organs for Guoker women. The rapid
emergence and blooming of these flesh tubes might be a sexual signal for
Guoker women, but because it happened so suddenly, it felt quite
unsettling and horrifying to me.</p>
<p>Willie also told me that Guoker men have retractable flesh tubes as
sexual organs, but only one, stored internally, and unfortunately, I
never saw it.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/kmXGQgM8WVnxu6T.png" width="289" height="385"></p>
<p>I could no longer withstand her teasing; as her soft tubes slightly
retracted, I instinctively rushed forward to embrace her, but she
swiftly dodged, agile and strong.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment, I need to activate a device. The information of our
lovemaking needs to be digitized; Norton needs this data.”</p>
<p>I thought to myself, “Damn, Norton, why do you need this
information?’ Willie said she had activated the device, but I did not
see how she had done it."</p>
<p>Suddenly, Willie leaped onto me like a frog, straddling my waist with
her legs. Her rounded shoulders and exceptionally smooth skin made
embracing her quite exhilarating. Unfortunately, when I penetrated her,
I found her too loose, lacking any sense of tightness or robust
friction. It was a bit disappointing; after all, aliens are indeed
different from us Earthlings.</p>
<p>At that moment, the phrase "like stirring a water tank with
chopsticks" came to mind. I recalled hearing about a robust and tall
woman in a nearby village who raped a schoolboy caught stealing
watermelons from her field. Caught red-handed at noon, the guilty boy
could only bow his head and accept her punishment. She first confiscated
his backpack and textbooks, then retreated into the watermelon shed,
with the boy following to retrieve his books. Once inside, the woman
forcefully pinned him to the ground. Quickly, she removed the boy’s
pants and her own, using her thick thighs, much wider than the boy’s
waist, to immobilize him. Holding his textbooks, she threatened to tear
them apart if he yelled, disobeyed, or resisted. Ultimately, she raped
the boy for an extended period before releasing him. Later, when the
older men in the village saw the boy, they would ask, "How does it feel?
Like stirring a water tank with chopsticks?" At the time, I was young
and just starting to understand matters of sex, so I grasped what they
implied.</p>
<p>After a while, Willie’s lower body revealed those soft, slender tubes
again. I realized that the bulging, rounded area between her legs housed
a large cavity, the storage space for these soft meat tubes. This cavity
extended all the way to their mouths; both Guoker males and females
lacked stomachs, intestines, livers, kidneys, and bladders, possessing
only a simple internal cavity. Later, I reached into her lower region
with my hand and could feel up to her throat area. On a normal,
non-sexually aroused occasion, I saw that these meat tubes were stored
inside the cavity, just their tips poking out, hanging like tiny purple
pickles.</p>
<p>Touching these tubes was akin to handling pig intestines—slimy and
dripping with mucus. Their sexual activity primarily relies on these
tubes, which are their actual sexual organs.</p>
<p>The bodies of Guoker individuals are artificially created. They
designed these meat tubes as the female sexual organs, enabling women to
dominate in sexual encounters and become the aggressors, while men are
rendered passive—a stark contrast to the common scenario on Earth where
it is typically men who impose themselves on women. Here, it is the
women who frequently rape the men.</p>
<p>If Guoker women dislike the male involved, they simply withhold their
meat tubes, leaving the man to encounter a vast, slack body cavity
devoid of pleasure, quickly losing interest. Conversely, if they favor
the male, they can proactively penetrate the man’s body with their
tubes, moving them around recklessly, indifferent to the man’s
discomfort. I have experienced this firsthand; whenever a Guoker woman
found me sexually appealing, her tubes would automatically extend. Even
if they didn’t project externally, they would twist and knot around my
penis internally, creating a sensation remarkably similar to that of a
human vagina, filled with excitement and pleasure. Sometimes, these
women could coil their tubes into a ball around my penis; as I thrust
and compressed it, the ball would gradually enlarge and suddenly burst,
releasing a burst of hot, spicy liquid that sent shivers through my
body.</p>
<p>Willie’s soft meat pipes touched my dick and wrapped it up quickly.
Gradually I felt the pleasure. However, my sleepiness suddenly came, I
really don’t want to go to sleep at this time.. What a pussy I was.</p>
<p>In my sleep, I went back to the Earth and went around telling about
my experience on the Guoker planet, but I became famous and was invited
by many countries. Once, I was invited by a research organisation in
Japan, and when I saw the 16- or 7-year-old daughter of the president of
the organisation, she was so beautiful that my heart was pounding, and I
dared not look at her directly because she was too sexy. However, she
was very interested in me, and during a break after the meeting, she
invited me to play in a field outside the house in a very secretive
manner. I followed her to the field, which was covered with tall grass,
and she suddenly squatted down, pushed up her skirt and left her panties
on, exposing her snow-white buttocks and red private parts, and then
cracked her mouth open and smiled at me.</p>
<p>This girl, her parents probably never control her, I said in my
heart, otherwise how to call the Japanese devils, men and women are
lecherous, really too bad, men to China like to rape Chinese women,
women like to go to Southeast Asia to prostitution.</p>
<p>I stood there and didn’t follow her any further. The girl simply took
off all her clothes and ran in circles in the grass. The dew on the
grass stained her snow-white, delicate skin, and her long hair flowed as
she ran, suddenly giving me a sense of extreme beauty. Her joyful,
carefree demeanour infected me, and my thoughts changed again. I thought
that they were in fact simple and happy, and that they were right, that
life was too short, and that we Chinese might be subjected to too many
constraints, and that we were living a life that was not too bitter.</p>
<p>The girl walked towards me. I was nervous, but I wanted to hug her.
Wait, wasn’t that Willie? I woke up, found myself laying on the bed.
Willie stood next to me naked. I leaped up in a strong impulse and threw
her onto the bed. I crushed her under me and fucked her hard. She became
excited too. It was a tough fight.</p>
<p>I learned it the hard way. Though small in size, the Guoker women
were super energetic and endurable. They can twist back and forth like a
motorcycle engine. Although my body strength is first-class on the
earth, but far from their opponent, we earthlings and their physical
quality is not the same level. In the end, I could only beg for
mercy.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-18---walking-in-the-clouds">Chapter 18 - Walking in the
Clouds</h2>
<p>Exhausted, I slept deeply until I was awakened by Willie gently
stroking my face. When I opened my eyes, it was already daylight.</p>
<p>"We’re going out to play today," Willie said, "I’ve arranged some
alone time for us with Norton and the others."</p>
<p>I understood that on Guoker Planet, where technology is highly
advanced, daily life for most people revolves around leisure—there’s no
need for labor or work.</p>
<p>I suggested that we visit the countryside. Willie looked at me,
utterly speechless.</p>
<p>"Let’s go to the countryside," I reiterated.</p>
<p>Willie continued to stare blankly; I suspected she didn’t know what
"countryside" meant, so I explained, "Let’s go play in the fields, in
places with soil."</p>
<p>Unsure if Willie understood, she pressed something near her ear, and
through the global teleportation network, we vanished from her home and
appeared on a natural terrain of Guoker Planet.</p>
<p>The soil was a rusty red, likely due to high iron oxide content. The
landscape was dominated by various plants—herbs, large trees, and exotic
flowers primarily in shades of green with specks of white, yellow, and
red, creating a vibrant tapestry. Occasionally, blue and black flowers
added a mysterious touch. Unlike Earth, the grass was sparse, and the
foliage was generally thick and waxy.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/uTBfPvAaz5OHDM3.png" width="384" height="512"></p>
<p>I noticed small ponds scattered across this iron-rich soil. Having
often caught ricefield eels back home, I examined the ponds to see if
they contained any, but while I spotted numerous aquatic creatures and
burrows along the pond edges, there were no eels or typical Earth
aquatic animals.</p>
<p>The sunlight was bright but chilly. As we strolled through the flora,
we came upon a green hut. As we approached, I realized it was made of
vines intricately woven together. The hut was two stories high, complete
with stairs, doors, and windows, all formed from vines. The ground floor
was also covered in an elaborate vine pattern. I noticed small insects
scurrying over the vines.</p>
<p>Inside the hut, I embraced Willie as we slowly walked around.
Suddenly, feeling as if I had experienced this in a past dream, I was
overcome by an inexplicable impulse and pinned Willie to the ground. We
rolled around on the vine-covered floor. Willie was not upset; instead,
she seemed receptive, and soon, her clothes vanished, leaving us to
engage joyously in physical intimacy.</p>
<p>I had vivid memories of a similar dream on Earth, where I had once
been intimate with a woman in such a setting. It often lingered in my
mind, but I never imagined it would become reality here.</p>
<p>Afterwards, as Willie’s pink skin slowly transformed back into
clothes, we walked out of the vine hut, arm in arm.</p>
<p>Before I could ask Willie where we should go next, I suddenly felt
lighter and both of us began hovering in the air. Shocked, I exclaimed,
"Whoa, what just happened?"</p>
<p>"I thought GMW could only teleport things and people from one place
to another. How does it make us hover?" I asked.</p>
<p>"GMW teleports us into the air, lets us drop a tiny distance, then
quickly teleports us up again, and repeats the process. This way, we end
up hovering in mid-air," Willie explained.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. Since GMW teleports us only very short distances and does
it so frequently, it feels like we aren’t moving at all, almost as if
we’re floating."</p>
<p>"Exactly, you’re really smart," she complimented.</p>
<p>Delighted, we continued our leisurely stroll through the sky. We even
ascended into the clouds, which were just thick fogs up high. It felt
exhilarating walking among them, although the ground below was obscured.
We eventually lowered our altitude to get a clearer view of the
landscape.</p>
<p>I marveled at how wonderful it was to have such advanced technology.
People could do whatever they desired, turning any thought into
reality—true freedom indeed.</p>
<p>Later, I became curious about whether Guoker Planet had any
rivers.</p>
<p>Willie informed me, "Our planet has plenty of water, not just in
rivers and lakes on land but also vast oceans."</p>
<p>We descended to the ground and found ourselves beside a winding
river. Standing on the dyke, I observed that the river, despite its
twists and turns, was clearly engineered. The dykes were artificially
constructed and covered with a continuous layer of a plastic-like
material, extending as far as the eye could see. The water was crystal
clear, free from any signs of pollution.</p>
<p>Curious about larger bodies of water, we explored major rivers and
vast lakes. Their banks were similarly constructed with neat, artificial
dykes. However, there were no residential buildings nearby.</p>
<p>At a vast lake, we paused to watch a variety of animals lounging on a
nearby grassland and perched on rocks. I suggested we take a closer
look. Using the GMW, Willie helped us descend the steep lake dyke. On
the grass, creatures resembling Earth’s soft-shell turtles basked in the
sun, scattering as they noticed us, revealing long tails. On a massive
rock, numerous large, fleshy animals resembling white maggots sunbathed.
They seemed indifferent to our presence; a few lazily raised their heads
to glance at us before resuming their sleep.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/cnRqA9TrY4bfCjh.png" width="318" height="170"></p>
<p>Figure: The turtle-like creatures who densely packed and basked in
the sun</p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge water column erupted from beneath the rock, spraying
the sunbathing animals into the air. Startled by this unexpected wave in
the calm lake, we approached and discovered a gigantic water monster
hidden beneath the rocks. Its mouth was as large as a house. The
creature had just spewed water, knocking the animals into its gaping
maw, where it now savored its catch.</p>
<p>Frightened, Willie and I decided to leave. "Let’s go back," I
suggested.</p>
<p>"Agreed, let’s return home," Willie said. "I’m too small to be a full
meal for that water monster, but you’re big enough to satisfy it. It
seems to like you." As soon as Willie finished speaking, we were
transported back to her house via the GMW.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-19---exploring-the-deep-ocean">Chapter 19 - Exploring
the Deep Ocean</h2>
<p>We returned to Willie’s home and rested for the night. The next day,
we discussed going out again. I suggested visiting the seaside because I
wanted to see the ocean on Guoker Planet; I had never seen the ocean on
Earth and was particularly keen to experience it.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Willie proposed that we explore the ocean’s depths, which she
promised would be thrilling. But how could we possibly go to the ocean
floor? By submarine? Submarines on Guoker Planet must be more advanced
than those on Earth. Could Willie manage to borrow one? It was her idea
after all, so she would have to handle the logistics. I agreed to her
plan.</p>
<p>"Are we going to use a submarine for our ocean floor visit?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," she replied.</p>
<p>"What do your submarines look like? Are they similar to those on
Earth?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, you’ll see when we get there," she answered cryptically.</p>
<p>We traveled via the GMW and arrived in front of a gigantic building.
Willie informed me that this was our departure point to the ocean floor.
Contrary to my expectations of seeing an endless ocean with buildings
along the shore and many submarines floating, ready to be rented to
tourists, this enormous, long building offered no view of the sea. I
wondered if we were in the wrong place, but then I thought it might be
similar to Earth’s train stations, where the trains are found just
behind the station buildings. Perhaps the ocean lay just beyond this
building.</p>
<p>Inside, Willie assured me we could directly access the ocean floor by
collecting a submarine here.</p>
<p>"Does it cost anything to get a submarine?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes, it requires wealth credits," she explained.</p>
<p>"What are wealth credits?"</p>
<p>"Here on Guoker, people earn wealth credits through labor, public
service, and helping others, all recorded by the GIW. Even if you do
nothing, you still accumulate a certain amount of wealth credits over
time. It’s somewhat like money on Earth, except it’s just a digital
number in the network, a form of virtual currency," Willie clarified.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>We entered the imposing and intricately designed building, where many
Guoker people bustled about, yet the ocean was still nowhere to be seen.
Willie led me to a sophisticated room, pressed her ear to send a message
via the GlW, and soon the door swung open.</p>
<p>The room was exquisitely beautiful, featuring a cylindrical stage at
the center, made from a material transparent like glass but evidently
more refined. The walls shone like polished metal. Upon entering, the
door shut automatically and several soft, black tubes descended from
above, lifting us gently onto the central stage. With a slight sound,
the stage began to rotate and descended into a pit. Suddenly, a misty 3D
hologram appeared before Willie, displaying numerous Guoker texts. She
deftly manipulated the hologram, which vanished shortly after she
announced everything was set.</p>
<p>I was anticipating the appearance of a submarine, or at least a
passage to one. Instead, only a black tube extended towards us, its tip
holding a small, soap-like red object. Willie took it and handed it to
me, instructing me to eat it.</p>
<p>"Why doesn’t Willie eat it herself?" I wondered suspiciously.
However, I quickly reassured myself, thinking that Willie wouldn’t harm
me. I began to eat the red substance, which tasted like a bland gummy
candy. Once it hit my stomach, it instantly activated, making me feel as
if a tremendous force was building inside me, ready to burst out. To my
alarm, I saw many soft, red filaments rapidly sprouting all over my
body. These filaments grew until they reached the edge of the stage and
then stopped. Overwhelmed by fear, I collapsed in the pit.</p>
<p>Willie quickly removed her clothes and straddled me, her face
expressing a seductive eagerness as she embraced me tightly. Although I
was receptive to her advances, I wondered if we should really be
preparing for our journey to the ocean floor instead. When I entered
her, a milky, glue-like liquid suddenly flowed into the pit, swirling
violently around us. Soon, a shark-shaped entity enveloped us. Inside
this shark, I could see through its eyes as if they were mine, and its
fins and tail felt like my arms and legs.</p>
<p>I began to understand: this shark was our submarine. On Guoker
Planet, submarines are these shark-like artificial creatures—a startling
revelation. The pit continued to descend and finally, we plunged into
the ocean.</p>
<p>Reaching the seabed, I saw an enormous, dark slab hanging at a
45-degree angle overhead, dotted with round holes from which other
shark-shaped submarines rapidly emerged—likely other Guoker tourists
exploring the ocean depths.</p>
<p>Suddenly, music played in my ears, sounding like a deep, thumping
bass that was quite uncomfortable and made my heart flutter. A voice
announced, "Welcome to the GlW. Underwater information processing mode
activated." A short while later, another message followed, "Thank you
for using the GIW. Underwater safety mode activated—please select your
desired oceanic region."</p>
<p>Unsure where to go, Willie suggested, "The Coal-ana Trench."</p>
<p>Muttering "The Coal-ana Trench," our surroundings instantly
transformed. After swimming for a while and seeing sunlight filtering
through the water above, I realized we were no longer near the
bio-submarine rental facility. We must have been transported to the
Coal-ana Trench by the Global Mobility Network. We reached the ocean
surface, where I struggled upward, feeling the water growing warmer
until my head broke through into a calm sea under a clear blue sky.</p>
<p>We began to descend again, initiating our true ocean floor adventure.
However, Willie became mischievous, engaging me intensely, which
distracted me from concentrating on our path. I was forced to roll with
her rhythm in the water. I tried to communicate with her, but she
ignored me, so I continued to engage until she finally let me be,
allowing us to smoothly cruise along the ocean floor.</p>
<p>We entered a long, artificially carved tunnel circling a mountain on
the ocean floor, partially open to the exterior. The tunnel’s edge was
lined with columns shaped like human heads. The tunnel branched into
several smooth paths, allowing us to glide swiftly. Some branches were
lined with soft, worm-like tendrils, and others with octopus-like
tentacles and snakes that nudged us along. Certain tunnels also released
a viscous, silky liquid periodically.</p>
<p>Closely observing the ocean floor, I noticed many signs of massive
artificial structures. This made me realize just how advanced Guoker
Planet’s technology must be; such feats would be impossible for
Earthlings beneath the sea.</p>
<p>Exiting the tunnel, we were suddenly bombarded by numerous red,
glowing spots that darted towards us, striking our shark-shaped
submarine. Upon closer inspection, I realized these were shrimp-like
creatures carrying the red dots. I felt a slight pain, and asked Willie
if she felt the same. She responded, "No, the thin red filaments on your
body act like nerves linked to this bio-submarine. You can feel
everything from the outside world through these filaments. I don’t have
them, so I don’t feel anything. However, I can see everything
outside."</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/e3RUf7TtyaGkd1p.png" width="123" height="128"></p>
<p>Figure: The shrimp-like creature</p>
<p>"Why can you see outside?"</p>
<p>"That’s due to the GIW. My brain is connected to it, and it gathers
all types of data from Guoker Planet—above ground, underground, and
underwater—providing me with continuous updates."</p>
<p>As we glided over the seabed, various fish swam above while many
strange plants gently swayed below us. The dim light added a dreamlike
quality to the scene. Furthermore, being underwater made me feel
weightless and completely liberated from societal judgment and physical
constraints, which easily amplified my sexual desires. Willie’s embrace,
combined with her ultra-smooth skin, made it challenging to resist
intimacy. I even began to suspect that her invitation to explore the
ocean floor was motivated by a desire for novel sexual experiences.
Watching through the video feed provided by Kevin, our submarine
appeared to sway drunkenly, unlike the smoothly swimming fish around
us.</p>
<p>Later, I noticed a small, silver fish perched on a seabed rock. It
looked almost artificial, with very sharp teeth. As I approached, Kevin
promptly warned, "Danger, javelin fish, possible mechanical injury,
non-toxic."</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/EYFgUt3OWLZrupn.jpg" width="151" height="157"></p>
<p>Figure: The javelin fish</p>
<p>Ignoring the warning, I moved closer to the fish. Suddenly, it shot
one of its teeth attached to a string towards us, hitting the back of
our submarine. The tooth quickly retracted, and I felt a sharp pain in
my back where a cloudy white fluid began to seep out.</p>
<p>Concerned about the damage to our submarine, Kevin informed me,
"Injury type: mechanical, non-toxic. GMW remote healing mode activated."
The submarine soon repaired itself, easing my worries. I did my best to
ignore Willie’s sensual provocations and focus on controlling the
submarine, which gradually returned to stable navigation.</p>
<p>Later we came across greater danger.</p>
<p>I noticed a dark, oval-shaped vertical cave that resembled a woman’s
vagina, with fish swimming in and out. Curiosity tempted me to explore
it, though I hesitated due to potential dangers. Nevertheless, reassured
by the protection of the GMW, I decided to venture in. The entrance felt
surprisingly soft, much like human skin. As we moved further, I realized
we had entered the mouth of a giant fish. The fish clamped its mouth
shut, and its massive, sharp teeth loomed towards us. Panic set in as I
realized we could be crushed within seconds. Suddenly, a message from
GMW announced, "Applying regional enclosure protection." A cylindrical
barrier formed around us, clearly visible from the different water flow
inside it. Unable to close its mouth, the fish eventually spat us out,
and we were safe.</p>
<p>Curious, I asked Willie, "Are there other Guoker people who enjoy
underwater adventures like us?"</p>
<p>"Definitely," she replied, "but it’s rare to encounter them. Our
planet’s oceans are much larger than Earth’s, and since everyone appears
similar in their submarine forms, it’s hard to make contact without the
Global Information Network. However, there are advanced life forms
living at the ocean floor that we can detect through the network. Would
you like to see them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I would."</p>
<p>Guided by Willie, I observed one of these life forms. It was a large,
white, flat-bodied fish, extremely streamlined, with eyes that seemed
almost sentient. It stared at us briefly before following.</p>
<p>Willie urged me to speed away, "This creature is extremely dangerous.
It’s a female, possibly tens of thousands of years old, with abilities
perhaps superior to those of us Guoker people. She can alter her body,
evolve independently, and has unimaginable powers, even capable of
breaching GMW’s protections. Our consciousness is backed up by the GlW,
which continuously tracks us. If she takes and damages my body beyond
repair, my consciousness can be installed in a new artificial body,
allowing for resurrection. That’s not a severe issue for us. However, if
she captures you, without a backup for your consciousness, the loss is
irreversible—you would truly die."</p>
<p>"Really? What does she want with my body? To consume me? To taste
something different?"</p>
<p>"No, they are not short of food. She may appear fish-like, but
internally, she harbors a humanoid body similar to mine. If she captures
you, she’ll pull you into her fish belly to control and entangle you,
initiating sexual contact that permanently binds your organs to hers,
making you her eternal sex slave."</p>
<p>"Why would she do that?"</p>
<p>"It’s rare for her to find a mate. According to Earth years, it might
be centuries before she encounters one. They are likely highly sexually
driven and wouldn’t easily let you escape."</p>
<p>"That sounds rather enjoyable, actually. What’s there to be afraid
of?"</p>
<p>"It’s not simply about sex. She won’t treat you gently. She’ll
brutally modify you, implant various organic tubes into your body,
injecting a venom developed over millions of years. This venom is
terrifyingly effective, designed to keep you subdued and in a vegetative
state, barely alive, and only fully conscious when she desires sexual
interaction."</p>
<p>"Well, that doesn’t sound too bad to me."</p>
<p>"But if she finds another male, she’ll swiftly expel you, and you’ll
die instantly."</p>
<p>"Ah, that is indeed terrifying. Let’s hurry away from her."</p>
<p>We quickly swam away, leaving the intelligent life form behind.
Later, I spotted numerous snake-like entities swaying on the ocean
floor. As I descended for a closer look, I saw creatures that resembled
a hybrid of human women and cobras.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/MU8BwWOXZ4Dqryv.png" width="67" height="218"></p>
<p>Figure: The snake people undersea</p>
<p>Willie explained that these were the ocean floor snake people, a type
of life form that exists somewhere between animals and plants. They were
naked, with soft pink bodies adorned with snake-like patterns, elongated
just like snakes, and possessed human-like faces and sensory organs.
Their eyes were elongated, while their mouths and noses were tiny. They
lacked arms and legs, had pointed small breasts, a vagina, and an
extremely slender waist. Their legs seemed to merge into a bizarre,
large mass of flesh. Upon noticing us, the snake people began to thrash
and dance wildly, assuming various seductive poses that were almost
irresistible.</p>
<p>Willie urged me to leave, saying, “These snake people are also
incredibly dangerous. They possess a potent toxin. If captured, they
will inject you with a venom that induces extreme pleasure. While you’re
enraptured, they will consume or dissolve parts of your body painlessly,
ultimately devouring you completely in a state of bliss.”</p>
<p>Feeling the peril of the Guoker Planet’s oceans, I longed for
home.</p>
<p>"How do we get back, Willie?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Through the GMW." Willie replied, "Had enough of the ocean??"</p>
<p>"Ah yes, I want back home. This place is terrifying to me."</p>
<p>"Alright, I’ll request the GMW to take us back."</p>
<p>Soon, we returned to the room with the round stage where we had first
entered the ocean. Our shark-shaped submarine slowly dissolved into a
sticky white liquid, and the thin red filaments on my body vanished.
Willie pressed her temple, and her bare, pinkish-white skin gradually
clothed itself in virtual garments—such convenience.</p>
<p>We approached the wall, which automatically opened a door. Hand in
hand, Willie and I stepped out, concluding our deep-sea adventure.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-20---invaded-by-undersea-snake-people">Chapter 20 -
Invaded by Undersea Snake People</h2>
<p>Upon returning, Willie and I shared our ocean floor encounter with
Norton and Suldair. When we mentioned the snake people, Norton revealed
that they were his research subject. He suggested that we take a flying
saucer back to the ocean floor for a detailed examination of the snake
people. Confused, I followed them without objection—after all, I didn’t
really have a say in the matter. This time, however, it seemed I had
fallen into Norton’s trap; his intentions were not entirely benign.</p>
<p>The flying saucer descended silently into the sea, much like a cloud
settling underwater. Initially, we used a 3D hologram to survey the
ocean floor. When we reached the area inhabited by the snake people, the
hologram expanded, making it feel as though we were looking through a
vast glass wall.</p>
<p>This part of the ocean wasn’t very deep, allowing sunlight to
illuminate the seafloor and provide a clear view. From a distance, the
snake people resembled numerous whips undulating collectively—a vast
array of thousands, with a withering yellow at the center surrounded by
vibrant pink. Norton explained that the yellow ones were dead snake
people, while the lively young females were pink.</p>
<p>He further explained that snake people, akin to plants, derive their
energy from sunlight but not through chlorophyll. Existing somewhere
between plants and animals, they are a type of parasitic species. Female
snake people prefer to infest male hosts; if they capture a male, they
invade his body, causing severe fevers and dissolving his internal
organs. Yet, they compensate their victims by inducing extreme pleasure.
Ultimately, the snake person and her male host die together.</p>
<p>As we observed, I couldn’t help but wonder—why do these snake people
wait for males only to die alongside them? Does it make any sense?
Though I was puzzled, I kept my thoughts to myself.</p>
<p>We moved closer to the snake people for a better view. They were
naked, with bodies as slender as snakes and similarly proportioned.
Their waists were as thin as my fingers. They lacked arms and legs;
instead, their lower bodies merged into one, and they had two long,
pointed breasts and a vagina. Their bodies were a soft, vivid pink,
reminiscent of a baby’s tongue on Earth, and covered in net-like
patterns of red, black, and white, much like a type of snake known as
“fire tongue chain” from my village.</p>
<p>These snake people had human-like faces and senses, with elongated
eyes angled upwards at 45 degrees, tiny but piercingly bright pupils,
and very small mouths and noses. They also had numerous soft, fleshy
tubes on their heads, giving them a distinctly sinister appearance.</p>
<p>Norton then suggested we exit the flying saucer to observe the snake
people up close. I saw that Norton, Suldair, and Willie had already
stepped outside, each enveloped in what appeared to be a transparent
plastic bag. Reluctantly, I followed, surrounded by an air bubble that
allowed me to breathe normally—likely another provision by the GMW.</p>
<p>As Norton and the others approached the snake people, the creatures
began a frenzied dance, their expressions eerily seductive. Having heard
from Norton that these snake people could burrow into our stomachs and
dissolve our organs, I was terrified and dared not get too close. I
chose a flat area to stand, feeling the ocean currents swirling around
me, my body drifting slightly. "I must not drift towards the snake
people," I thought anxiously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, for reasons unknown, the air bubble enveloping me burst
into countless small bubbles, rising to the surface. I was submerged in
the cold seawater, unable to breathe. To make matters worse, the nearest
group of snake people seemed to notice me. They rhythmically danced,
creating currents that pulled me helplessly toward them. I looked around
for Norton and the others, but the flying saucer and its crew had
vanished without a trace. Despair washed over me. I closed my eyes,
hoping it was all just a nightmare, and that I would wake up safely in
Willie’s bed. However, when I opened my eyes, I was floating above the
snake people. Despite my struggles, their tentacle-like appendages
reached me.</p>
<p>I felt like I was plummeting into a pit of snakes. Initially, my legs
were ensnared by their chillingly cold bodies. A mere touch from them
sent shivers of fear and revulsion through me. Then, my arms and waist
were wrapped by the snake-like creatures. It felt as though I was being
bound by cold, slimy intestines. Eventually, my entire body was tightly
coiled by layers of these creatures, their grip growing ever tighter,
making it difficult to breathe. The few parts of my body that weren’t
bound felt as if countless snake tongues were licking and probing
them.</p>
<p>Resigned to my fate, I stopped struggling, closed my eyes, and tried
to convince myself it was just a nightmare. But the snake people were
cruel. They opened their mouths and extended long, slender, purple-black
tongues that pried my eyes open, forcing me to witness the horror.
Despite their small heads, their mouths could stretch wide open in a
terrifying manner, revealing sharp, sinister teeth, and a dark purple,
almost black, interior. Their tongues writhed flexibly.</p>
<p>At one point, one of the snake people entered my mouth, bringing with
it a foul-smelling, sticky slime that made me gag. Powerless to resist,
I felt other snake people tightening their grip around my neck,
enhancing the pressure as one forced its way down my throat. It reached
my stomach and expelled a copious amount of viscous liquid, causing
intense nausea and a burning sensation. Strangely, it was then that I
felt like I could breathe again, no longer feeling suffocated.</p>
<p>The ordeal worsened as the snake people forcibly spread my legs
nearly 180 degrees apart. I anticipated an invasion from behind. Soon, a
cold, soft appendage entered through my anus. I knew their deceitful
nature too well; several snake people constricted my abdomen,
intensifying the internal pressure and friction, which they seemed to
relish. As the friction increased, an overwhelming sense of pleasure
surged through me, causing my body to tremble and convulse
uncontrollably. The once nauseating stench of their slime now strangely
vanished, replaced by a spicy, almost desirable sensation within my
stomach and intestines. A new craving for the liquid emerged, even as a
wave of fear and panic hit me—was it dissolving my organs?</p>
<p>As my fever escalated, my body felt lighter, almost as if floating
upwards. Amidst this, beautiful hallucinations appeared; I saw numerous
lovely girls caressing and embracing me, their tender touches felt both
inside and out. Was this what Norton had warned about? Were the snake
people dissolving my organs, bringing me close to death?</p>
<p>If Norton and the others didn’t intervene soon, I feared it would be
the end for me. Just as I reached a peak of delirious pleasure, it felt
as if the snake people were abruptly severed from me by invisible sharp
blades. Suddenly, I found myself lying on a bed, the recent ordeal
seeming like a nightmare. However, the sensation of the snake people
still stuffed inside me, filling me up, was a visceral reminder that it
hadn’t been a dream.</p>
<p>It seemed someone was assisting me, extracting the snake people’s
remains through my anus.</p>
<p>When I finally regained full consciousness, I saw Norton, Suldair,
and Willie standing nearby.</p>
<p>"Take a look at these," Norton said, pointing to what appeared to be
a tray. "These are the skeletal remains of the snake people. We had to
use a specialized scanner to remove them from your body; you wouldn’t
have been able to expel them on your own."</p>
<p>The bones, laid out like delicate fish spines, were white and
exceedingly fine. I sensed Norton might want to ask how it felt to have
the snake people inside me, but this time, no questions were asked.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-21---visiting-the-artificial-field-generation-center-on-guoker-planet">Chapter
21 - Visiting the Artificial Field Generation Center on Guoker
Planet</h2>
<p>The most important infrastructure on Guoker Planet is the artificial
field generator, which powers the planets miraculous GMW teleportation
technology. Finally I got a chance to visit the artificial field
generator center (AFGC) with Willie, Norton and Suldair.</p>
<p>I asked where on Planet Guoker the artificial field generator was
located. Suldair pointed at the sky, and even in the daylight, I saw a
silvery-gray satellite.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/pgbI2smHMjQocXu.png" width="359" height="479"></p>
<p>Using the GMW, the four of us were instantly transported to the AFGC.
It was only upon arriving that I realized the AFGC was incredibly vast;
inside, it was impossible to grasp the scale of things. The interior was
lined with rows of exquisitely crafted metal rooms, primarily in
lead-gray and silver hues. The rooms lacked any bulbs, instead, the
entire walls emitted a soft glow. However, I didn’t see any of the
virtual structures that are common on the planets surface.</p>
<p>I exclaimed in awe, "Wow, its massive, like stepping onto another
planet. This place shouldn’t be called just an artificial field
generator; it’ s more like a artificial field center."</p>
<p>Suldair agreed, saying, "Exactly, this is the AFGC, housing the most
crucial equipment—the artificial field generators. The AFGC serves not
only as a teleportation hub for the GMW but also as the central energy
provider for Planet Guoker. It’s also the core of the GIW and the
planets data processing center. Unlike Earth, where electrical energy is
used, we use field energy. The AFGC is essentially the planet’s hub for
energy emission, motion dispatching, information processing, and energy
reception, collecting power through stellar energy receivers. If such a
device existed on Earth, it would be called a Solar Energy Concentration
Receiver.</p>
<p>"AFGCs are akin to the geostationary satellites on Earth. Our planet
has nine of these centers, and some of the smaller nearby planets have
six. This center is also one of my workplaces, but I don’t need to be
physically present often. Instead, I occasionally visit and mostly work
remotely via the GIW."</p>
<p>"Brother Qian, did you know?" Willie said, "The core area of the AFGC
doesn’t provide teleportation services."</p>
<p>"Oh, I understand," I responded. "It’s like barbers on Earth who can
cut anyone’s hair but their own."</p>
<p>Norton interjected, "The gravity we feel here in the AFGC is actually
artificially created."</p>
<p>There are many employees at the AFGC, each about one meter tall. They
turned to watch us as we passed by, likely drawn by my larger stature.
There was quite a bit of murmuring among them, but Kevin didn’t
translate, so I had no idea what they were discussing."</p>
<p>"As we walked, we suddenly found ourselves floating about 30
centimeters (roughly one foot) above the ground, swiftly transitioning
from walking to cruising through the air. I didnt ask why; with so many
wondrous technologies on Guoker, it no longer surprised me.</p>
<p>We quickly reached the core area of the AFGC. Suldair pointed to a
massive ring-shaped pipe, saying, By Earth measurements, the ring’s
diameter would be about 10 kilometers (about 6.2 miles), and the pipe’s
diameter nearly one kilometer (about 0.62 miles).</p>
<p>He continued, "This is the core component of the artificial field
generator—the particle circumfluence device. Most other equipment here
serves a supportive role. Another vital device is the star energy
concentration receiver, much smaller, specifically for capturing star
energy—similar to solar energy as known on Earth. Well have a chance to
see the star energy receiver shortly."</p>
<p>I asked, "What’s the fundamental principle of this AFGC?"</p>
<p>Norton explained, "It operates similarly to our flying saucers—by
creating positive and negative gravitational fields that affect the
surrounding space and time, through altering the electromagnetic
field."</p>
<p>At that moment, it appeared that the AFGCs administrator came out to
greet Suldair and Norton. They went into another room, possibly for a
meeting. Norton signaled for Willie to accompany me on the tour.</p>
<p>My curiosity piqued, I asked Willie, "How could flying saucers and
this AFGC operate on the same principle?"</p>
<p>"Both the flying saucer and the artificial field consume the space
around them, thereby affecting the mass and charge distribution of the
objects within that space,"Willie explained with a charming tone, yet it
was hard to grasp.</p>
<p>I pressed on, "How do flying saucers and the artificial field
generator consume the space around them?"</p>
<p>"Changing electromagnetic fields can produce positive and negative
gravitational fields. The negative gravitational field propels away from
the AFGC at the speed of light, and as it hits an object, it erases the
space around the object as well as its mass and electrical charge.
Without mass and charge, the object enters an excited state and begins
moving at the speed of light, acquiring many extraordinary properties.
This is as much as I understand, and I admit it’s not entirely clear to
me either."</p>
<p>While I bent down to speak with Willie, she suddenly wrapped her arms
around my neck, pressing her head against my chin, and softly asked, "Do
you have any other questions?"</p>
<p>"What exactly is a field?" I asked.</p>
<p>"A field involves space changing through movement in a cylindrical
spiral pattern. Any more questions?" she responded.</p>
<p>"No..." I was swept up in a flutter of emotions and ceased my
inquiries.</p>
<p>Willie behaved like a clingy kitten, constantly circling around me.
Sometimes she would position herself in front of me, causing me to trip.
She enjoyed using the GMW to make her body weightless, floating at the
same height as mine, or sometimes positioning her legs level with my
head. Then, like a catfish, she would circle around my upper body or
even sit on my neck. We were both in virtual clothing, essentially
naked. Her extremely smooth skin and the plump folds of flesh as she
rode my neck were overwhelmingly stimulating.</p>
<p>This spectacle often unfolded in front of others, which was quite
embarrassing for me, but Willie, along with Norton and their friends,
seemed unconcerned. I frequently asked her to keep her distance, but she
ignored my requests. Yet, there were times when I truly desired to be
close to her and engage in intimacy, but she would not reciprocate.
Their strange dispositions were something I felt people from Earth might
never understand.</p>
<p>Hand in hand, Willie and I glided 30 centimeters (about one foot)
above the ground.</p>
<p>We finally arrived behind the particle circumfluence device and
observed the star energy concentration receiver. Unlike the immense
particle circumfluence device, the star energy concentration receiver
consisted of numerous rings on a large panel. These rings seemed painted
onto the surface, with dark spots possibly representing holes or other
materials at their centers—details were hard to discern from a
distance.</p>
<p>I wanted to get a closer look, but Willie cautioned, "This area is
too dangerous; youre not allowed near it. Besides, you wouldnt be able
to find your way there."</p>
<p>"Does the star energy concentration receiver affect the surrounding
space by concentrating stellar light energy before collecting it?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," she explained. "Your Earths solar panels can only capture the
solar energy that falls directly on them, square meter by square meter.
However, these concentration receivers can compress space, enabling them
to gather millions, even billions, of square meters of solar energy on
just one square meter of the panel."</p>
<p>"Wow, thats impressive! But could they also destroy spaceships
passing through?" I wondered aloud.</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly, the Guoker people realized this issue early on. Weve
segmented space into a grid so that the star energy concentration
receiver affects only specific grid sections, minimizing any impact on
spaceships."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by grid?" I asked.</p>
<p>Willie sketched lines in the air, both horizontally and vertically,
and said, "Like this, Brother Qian. You’re a smart guy; you should be
able to understand."</p>
<p>"Okay," I replied, though I still didn’t quite grasp it.</p>
<p>"The star energy concentration receiver not only beams energy into
space but also directs it downward to the planets surface, reducing the
amount of star energy—or as you call it on Earth, solar energy—that
reaches us. With electronic computer analysis, we can artificially
adjust the atmosphere, almost like installing a giant air conditioner on
Guoker. This allows us to control our planets weather and effectively
prevent harmful weather conditions.</p>
<p>"On Earth, disasters like hurricanes, typhoons, heavy rain, and
lightning are driven by solar energy. Here, we use computers to
determine how much star energy to absorb in each area, strategically
distributing energy to prevent these hazards. We never experience
disastrous weather because everything is under our control. However,
severe weather on your planet causes many deaths each year, right?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, yes. If we Earthlings had this technology to concentrate solar
energy, it would be fantastic!"</p>
<p>"Then you should go back and build one, Brother Qian. You could
become a billionaire on Earth!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Later, the four of us regrouped as we were preparing to leave the
AFGC. Suddenly, I noticed something incredible: some of the doors in the
AFGC opened directly into space. I couldnt help but ask, "Why is the
AFGC designed this way, allowing air to escape into space so
quickly?"</p>
<p>Suldair gestured dismissively towards the door, "Just go and feel it
for yourself."</p>
<p>I rushed to the door and pushed against it, only to be stopped by an
invisible force. Ah, it was just a virtual wall, colorless, which had
tricked me.</p>
<p>After using the artificial field to teleport back to Willie’s home, I
was still pondering over the AFGC, curious about how it did not affect
people or the environment. Willie, Norton, and Suldair seemed
uninterested in discussing these questions and ignored my inquiries,
choosing to talk about other topics instead. Reluctantly, I dropped the
subject.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-22-virtual-light-people">Chapter 22 – Virtual Light
People</h2>
<p>Once, while with Norton, Suldair and Willie, we encountered some
peculiar Guoker people. These individuals seemed weightless, floating as
they walked, yet their physique and expressions were indistinguishable
from ordinary Guokers. Suddenly, I saw them glide right through a wall
as if it posed no barrier at all.</p>
<p>I immediately thought it might be the Global Motion Network assisting
them, but GMN typically facilitates movement so rapidly that its
invisible to the naked eye. I was curious; my intuition told me these
were not ordinary Guokers.</p>
<p>"Wow, these people are so strange! How did they get into the house
through the wall? Can you do that?" I asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>"Theyre virtual light beings from Guoker planet," Willie responded
nonchalantly, "Youve already seen them at Nortons place."</p>
<p>"Oh, so buildings can be virtual, and so can people? The virtual
buildings Ive seen always seem to tremble slightly. Why dont these
people exhibit the same trembling?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"The standards for buildings are lower; their appearance can be
roughly rendered by the artificial field imaging technology, but virtual
people are rendered with much finer detail. When the imaging is
sufficiently refined, you cant detect any trembling," Willie explained,
though I was still puzzled.</p>
<p>Noticing my confusion, Norton offered a more technical explanation:
"You still have much to learn about virtual beings. We Guokers have
developed artificial field scanning technology that captures and records
human consciousness, storing these records in computers. Originally, the
idea was that once our technology evolved sufficiently, we could
manufacture bodies to house these recorded consciousnesses, allowing us
to swap bodies and achieve immortality.</p>
<p>"These digital consciousnesses were not meant to remain idle in
computers; instead, they were active within the network, forming the
earliest virtual beings of Guoker. Initially, these virtual beings
existed only within Guokers computers and networks, and real people
needed image display devices to interact with and see them. Moreover,
their appearances changed frequently, lacking a consistent human
identity.</p>
<p>"Back then, the digital consciousnesses of Guokers ran on networks
and computers, and we encountered a significant issue. Human
consciousness, when residing in the brain, is generally immutable, but
once transferred to computers and networks, it becomes susceptible to
modification by others or even oneself. This frequent tampering with
digital consciousnesses caused substantial negative side effects."</p>
<p>Later, we introduced the concept of the "Personal Source Code,"
allowing individuals consciousness to revert to its initial recorded
state under certain conditions. This concept became crucial once we were
capable of creating life and constructing human bodies. If such
technology—preserving consciousness and switching bodies to achieve
immortality—were to be realized on Earth, the "Personal Source Code"
would undoubtedly become an essential and unavoidable concept for
Earthlings.</p>
<p>Initially, our virtual beings were merely represented by light but
were not true light-based virtual entities. As 3D virtual imaging and
artificial field scanning technologies evolved, virtual beings were able
to step out from behind networks and screens. Composed of light images,
these three-dimensional virtual beings began appearing on our streets
and eventually in every corner of the real world.</p>
<p>The virtual light beings you see are crafted through remote locking
of local light and colors by artificial field scanning technology,
coupled with 3D holographic imaging. Without this technology to lock the
light, managing light that encounters physical obstructions becomes
challenging.</p>
<p>Virtual beings appear dimmer at night due to less available light to
lock, whereas during the day, they are brighter and clearer due to ample
natural light. However, its common to artificially enhance the locked
light at night, making the virtual beings appear exceptionally
bright.</p>
<p>These virtual beings are consistently tracked and supported by the
GMW, GIW, and GPS, requiring massive data flow. Essentially, virtual
people are products of vast data collections, impossible without the
powerful storage and computing capabilities of artificial field scanning
computers, which are billions of times more powerful than Earths
computers.</p>
<p>Although virtual people are composed only of light and lack physical
bodies, they possess self-awareness. This consciousness, fundamentally
informational, is stored digitally within computers and operates within
them. Virtual beings can interact and form emotional connections,
establish romantic relationships, and even engage in sexual activities,
both with each other using proxies and with real humans, exhibiting the
full range of human thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>Yet, virtual people experience the physical world very differently
from real humans. They have no need to eat, drink, or excrete, hence no
feelings of hunger, satiety, or thirst. They do not feel their own
weight and are free from physical ailments since they lack physical
bodies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, virtual people can suffer from mental illnesses and
experience happiness and pleasure. They come in male, female, and
neutral genders, and can be heterosexual or homosexual.</p>
<p>Their perception and understanding of physical concepts such as
space, time, force, heat, light, and sound differ significantly from
ours. Movement from one place to another is effortless and unconstrained
for them; no physical object can obstruct them, they perceive no
barriers, and can enter and exit places at will. Virtual beings
effectively live in a two-dimensional world, existing merely as
non-material collections of information.</p>
<p>Additionally, virtual people perceive the physical world—including
space, time, force, heat, light, and sound—very differently from us.
They can move from one location to another with ease and freedom that
physical beings cannot match. No object can obstruct them; they have no
concept of physical barriers. They simply go wherever they desire,
entering and exiting at will. Virtual people face no spatial
constraints; they essentially live in a two-dimensional world, existing
merely as non-material collections of data.</p>
<p>Virtual people experience time differently from us physical beings.
They have no concept of day or night and do not require sleep for rest.
They are impervious to extreme temperatures, allowing them to navigate
environments as perilous as volcanoes and glaciers with ease.</p>
<p>The virtual people of Guoker evolved gradually, particularly as
artificial field scanning and virtual imaging technology advanced. This
technology enabled pure virtual beings, previously confined to computer
networks, to be projected anywhere on Guoker as holographic light
beings.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see," I remarked, "so the artificial field locks certain light
rays on the street to create visual representations of people. But these
individuals arent actually there; they continue to exist digitally
within computers."</p>
<p>Norton added, "Correct, but it’s not quite that simple. The GMW
deploys the artificial field imaging technology, supported by the GIW
and GPS, which captures detailed environmental data and transmits it to
the virtual people. This process ensures they receive the same, if not
more detailed, information as a physical person would in that location.
Everything relevant to these virtual individuals is also collected and
transmitted to them in real time.</p>
<p>"You see, virtual people can manipulate physical objects because they
send signals to the GMW, which then facilitates these actions through
its network.</p>
<p>"How do virtual people engage in sexual relationships with each other
or with real people?" I asked.</p>
<p>"There are a couple of methods," he explained. "One is using
frequency interception technology, which transmits the sexual activity’s
digital signals directly into the brains of both parties, linking and
interacting their sensations, memories, and consciousness with that of
the virtual person. Another method involves using proxies, such as
remotely operated manikins, or activating two sets of information-clay
bodies that are connected to the virtual person’s hologram via
artificial field scanning."</p>
<p>Suldair’s statement took me by surprise: "In fact, 90% of our
population are virtual beings."</p>
<p>"Virtual people are seen as failures in reality; they’ve grown weary
of it and have retreated into the virtual world," Willie commented.
"Actually, every individual possesses both a real body and a virtual
identity within the network—its simply a matter of preference whether
one chooses to appear as a virtual being or as a physical person."</p>
<p>Her words astounded me further. "Everyone has both virtual and real
identities, and in special cases, a person might have multiple bodies
and virtual identities. Your ‘body’ isn’t limited to human forms; you
could be a spaceship, a fish, a castle—of course, these entities are
highly intelligent, capable of receiving and processing human
consciousness, allowing for interaction. In essence, these entities are
alive, not inanimate."</p>
<p>Norton said, "Generally, we refer to those who persistently refuse to
appear in a real body as virtual people.”</p>
<p>Later, I returned to Willies place, still fascinated by the topic of
virtual people. I bombarded Willie with endless questions. Today, she
seemed very patient and thoroughly explained everything about virtual
people. Finally, she swiped her hand through the air, and a mist arose
beside me, displaying various images through a hologram as if she were
becoming my teacher.</p>
<p>"Does every virtual person have a backup body ready so they can
switch to a real body whenever they want?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, thats correct," Willie responded.</p>
<p>"Where are these backup bodies kept then?"</p>
<p>"Look here," Willie pointed at the virtual screen. I saw several
translucent containers filled with liquid, each holding a dormant, naked
human. Among them, some beautifully formed female bodies caught my eye,
causing an involuntary reaction that made my face turn red. Willie
noticed and looked at me with a peculiar expression.</p>
<p>"Does each virtual person need a backup body?"</p>
<p>"Not really, only a few virtual people request to revert to their
real bodies each day," she replied.</p>
<p>"Can I exist as both a virtual person and a real person?"</p>
<p>"That would create two instances of you, leading to mental suffering
and confusion—no one wants that kind of trouble," she explained.</p>
<p>Eventually, Willie grew tired of my relentless questioning and
refused to engage further. Instead, she offered me a computer program to
experience life as a virtual person. She instructed me to lie down on
the bed as she set up the virtual computer. Suddenly, I found myself in
a bizarre world where everything seemed painted. I floated down the
street while a voiceover asked, "Where are you going? Do you need a
partner? Please make your selection."</p>
<p>I noticed five beautiful women nearby, all excitingly waving at me.
If this were Earth, I wouldnt dare to look directly at them because Ive
always felt inferior, coming from a poor rural background where
beautiful women seemed out of reach.</p>
<p>Now, empowered to choose, I felt thrilled. I selected one, but up
close, she resembled Willie—was this the type I preferred? As I
hesitated, the other four vanished in disappointment. I later chose a
few pets that floated around me, accompanying me on my travels.
Continuous voiceover prompts urged me to make decisions, but lacking
experience, I sometimes chose poorly, leading me back to the start or
making random selections.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the journey eventually got smoother. I experienced many
incredible sensations—I could leap onto mountains in a single bound,
pass through walls, float and soar through the air, and feel as if my
body was as soft as silk. I could go anywhere instantly. But then I
realized no scenic beauty could compare to the beauty of a woman. I
began searching for beautiful women everywhere until I realized the
woman who had been accompanying me was right there. I approached her
slowly, embraced her, and felt a profound sense of pleasure during our
hug. Suddenly, I felt as if I had awakened from a dream. Willie was
standing beside me, watching intently.</p>
<p>Later, I played these virtual reality games on several occasions,
immersing myself in the extraordinary sensations of being a virtual
person. Initially, through field scanning, I was put into a state of
weightlessness, similar to how astronauts are trained underwater on
Earth. This is because most virtual people living in computer networks
do not experience gravity unless it is specifically programmed. Removing
the sensation of gravity not only brought me closer to the experience of
virtual beings but also diminished my self-awareness of reality. They
severed my connection to the real world, making me unable to feel
gravity, time, space, color, temperature, sound, or scent, thus freeing
me from these influences. Only by completely detaching from the real
environment and forgetting the real world, could I truly immerse myself
and live within the virtual world.</p>
<p>When you become a virtual person in the Guoker planet’s computer
networks, you start by feeling very alert, not at all like being in a
drowsy or half-awake state. The virtual environment appears
different—blurred and constantly changing colors. Distinguishing between
sky and earth is difficult; sometimes, it feels as if the ground is
overhead and space below your feet, or that space is merely a narrow gap
between two expanses of earth.</p>
<p>Most of the time, there is no sense of being in a fixed place.
Surroundings and colors are always shifting. Different areas have their
own color themes; for example, you might enter an area where everything
is tinted red, then move to another that’s purple or cyan. Virtual
people can exist simultaneously in multiple locations and view their
bodies from various perspectives.</p>
<p>Virtual people experience time differently from physical beings. They
hardly feel the passage of time and often cannot tell the sequence of
events. Its common for them to experience time as if it were flowing
backward, with recent events seeming to repeat themselves.</p>
<p>Disorientation is common; its hard to familiarize oneself with any
environment, and the sense of spacetime chaos is profound. People and
objects appear to float aimlessly in every direction. Unlike in the real
world, where everything is grounded, here, people and items drift
through the sky and the depths of the sea.</p>
<p>The size of objects and beings can change unpredictably, and their
movements can start and stop abruptly. It’s not unusual for someone who
appears far away to suddenly be right in front of you. You might walk a
great distance only to find yourself back where you started. Its often
more accurate to perceive your surroundings with your intuition rather
than relying on sight.</p>
<p>Virtual people feel no physical weight; their bodies are light, like
tufts of cotton, capable of flying and stopping at will. They are
fearless, knowing they cannot be harmed by physical collisions or
attacks. Initially, you might feel scared when someone swings a blade at
you, but as it passes harmlessly through your body, even providing a
peculiar sense of relief, you gradually become braver. Soon, no matter
how dangerous a situation may seem in the real world, it does not incite
fear, except when faced with bizarre creatures or scenes.</p>
<p>Virtual people can teleport to any location instantly, soar through
the air effortlessly, and experience their bodies as soft and buoyant,
like fluff. They can also divide into filaments or disperse into dust
particles. Unaffected by extreme temperatures, they can freely enter
hostile environments such as volcanoes and glaciers, jump off cliffs
without hesitation, pass slowly through walls, or travel deep into the
Earth’s core with ease. When virtual people embrace, they can seamlessly
merge into each others bodies, experiencing an extraordinary sense of
freedom. At times, they can freely morph their bodies into fragments,
fluids, or vapors. They can appear solid but quickly transition into
liquid or gas states, switching between them at will.</p>
<p>Virtual people can join any computer game instantly, becoming a
character within that digital realm. They are not bound by the
constraints of day or night and do not require sleep. There are no
concepts of spatial distance or physical barriers for them; they can
move through any material and cover vast distances effortlessly. With
just a thought, they can be anywhere instantly.</p>
<p>Virtual people can experience happiness and pleasure and have the
capacity for both heterosexual and homosexual relationships. They exist
as males, females, and neutrals, capable of communicating and forming
emotional and romantic relationships, not only with each other but also
with real humans. They can even engage in unique sexual relationships
through data and physical interaction.</p>
<p>However, virtual people can also experience mental anguish. They
cannot commit suicide or kill another virtual person. If someone tries
to kill a virtual person, attacking their holographic body is futile;
one would need to locate the network and computer where their data
resides and destroy it to truly eliminate them.</p>
<p>In their normal state, virtual light people feel like touching air,
but they can utilize GMW to create force fields around themselves. This
allows them to simulate realistic tactile sensations, offering different
textures and feedback when touched.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-23---the-chrono-fridge-on-guoker-planet">Chapter 23 -
The Chrono Fridge on Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>Once, after a meal at Willies house, we had some leftovers. I asked,
"On Earth, we can store food in a refrigerator. Im from a poor rural
area without one, though Ive seen in movies that city dwellers usually
have fridges. But Willie, I noticed that there doesn’t seem to be a
fridge on your Planet. Oh, I get it! With your advanced teleportation
technology, you don’t need to refrigerate food, right?"</p>
<p>Willie responded, "Actually, we do have fridges. Theyre generally
quite large but not commonly used for storing food. Our fridges serve
different purposes than those on Earth."</p>
<p>"So, let me guess, because your teleportation technology is so
convenient, you use a massive fridge like a public storage facility.
Everyone stores their items there and retrieves them conveniently via
GMW teleportation, just as easily as if they were stored at home. This
saves electricity and space, right?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly," Willie corrected. "We absorb all the nutrients we need
through computer-controlled teleportation directly into our bodies, so
we seldom need food or a fridge. Our fridges are mainly used for
industrial production and scientific research."</p>
<p>Willie waved her hand, and a 3D holographic image created by GMW and
GIWs remote transmission technology appeared beside her. She accessed
the GIW browser, showing many of Guoker Planets gigantic fridges that
looked like buildings, all labeled in Guoker script.</p>
<p>Willie continued to explain, "Our fridges dont use low-temperature
freezing. Instead, we employ a method that solidifies time. An
artificial field irradiates the interior space of the chrono fridge,
making the time within it different from the outside. Its as if time for
the items inside is frozen. If you put food in it, even though thousands
of years might pass outside, only a minute passes inside. This is why we
call it a chrono fridge.</p>
<p>"For example, if you place an ice cream from Earth inside a chrono
fridge, the temperature inside is the same as outside. But a year later,
the ice cream would have experienced less than a second, virtually
unchanged when retrieved."</p>
<p>"Wow! Your chrono fridge is amazing, way beyond my expectations! So,
if I were to stay inside briefly, could it be that thousands of years
would pass outside?"</p>
<p>"Exactly," Willie confirmed. "On Earth, you would probably freeze to
death in a regular fridge. But if a chrono fridge were placed on Earth
and you stepped inside for a moment, by the time you step out, your
family and neighbors would have been gone for thousands of years,
turning you into an instant ancient relic and a celebrity akin to a
major museum or zoo exhibit." Willie gave a peculiar laugh.</p>
<p>"And what if it were reversed? If I spent a year inside the chrono
fridge, but only a few hours passed outside?"</p>
<p>"That’s perfectly possible," she replied. "Our chrono fridge has
adjustable settings and a time shift switch. Setting it low means one
minute inside equals one year outside; setting it high means one minute
could equal thousands of years outside. If you hit the minus on the time
shift switch, it reverses the flow, making time inside pass faster than
outside."</p>
<p>I asked curiously, "Can the chrono fridge reverse time? Is it
possible for me to return to ancient times?"</p>
<p>Willie replied confidently, "Thats impossible! The perception of
times speed is based on the comparison between two different locations.
We say time moves faster in one place by comparing it to another. How
can you compare the same location? It’s like asking how one part of your
body can be taller than another. You can say youre taller than me, but
not that one part of you is taller than another. Time cannot flow
backwards, and neither can the chrono fridge make it do so."</p>
<p>I sort of understood her explanation. "Then what exactly is
time?"</p>
<p>"Time is merely our perception of space radiating at the speed of
light," Willie answered vaguely. "Without people, there is no concept of
time. That’s all I really know about it. If you want a more detailed
explanation, youd need to ask Suldair."</p>
<p>Willie suggested we visit a bio-research institute on Guoker Planet
that uses giant chrono fridges. I agreed, and she contacted the
institute’s manager via GIW to inform them of an Earth visitors
impending arrival.</p>
<p>"Would it be alright to invite Norton as well? He’s a renowned
biologist here on Guoker Planet," Willie asked for my opinion.</p>
<p>"Absolutely!" I readily agreed.</p>
<p>Upon Willie’s request through GMW, we instantly teleported to a large
building where Norton awaited us at the entrance. Inside, everyone
showed deep respect for Norton, and Willie whispered to me that they
were under his leadership.</p>
<p>The manager who greeted us looked male, about a meter tall, with a
facial resemblance to Norton but distinctively different due to his hair
made of long, soft, black tubular strands that fell over his
shoulders.</p>
<p>Willie explained that his name was Wentai and his hair served special
purposes during intimacy with women, providing pleasure in unique ways.
Willie declined to elaborate, leaving me to imagine the specifics.</p>
<p>Wentai led us through the institute, speaking so quickly that the GIW
translation service struggled to keep up. Honestly, I was more casually
observing the unusual equipment than seeking to understand it
deeply.</p>
<p>Later, I saw a row of glass-like containers filled with a slightly
yellow, translucent liquid, each holding various naked human bodies.
Some were enormous, reaching four to five meters tall, while others were
mere tens of centimeters.</p>
<p>Among them, I noticed a human female body that closely resembled
Earth humans, exceptionally voluptuous with massive breasts and thighs
as thick as barrels, standing about two meters tall. Her alluring form
was connected to external tubes. These bodies appeared drowsy or
sedated, each connected by tubes.</p>
<p>When Willie noticed my bewildered expression, she slapped me and
exclaimed, "Damn! GIWs translator didnt interpret this, but I guessed it
might be a Guoker expletive.</p>
<p>Wentai explained, "These are Guoker backup bodies. For instance, when
Guokers need to carry out missions on Earth, they sometimes use bodies
that resemble humans to blend in. None of these bodies in the containers
possess consciousness."</p>
<p>"We utilize field scanning technology to download a Guokers
consciousness into a body similar to those on Earth, and store the
original Guoker body in a container. This allows the individual to
undertake exploration missions on Earth using the Earth-like body. Upon
completing the mission, we reverse the process: the Earth-like body is
stored, and the consciousness is transferred back to the Guoker body,
allowing them to resume life on Guoker Planet with their normal body and
consciousness."</p>
<p>Curious about the infrastructure, I asked, "What’s the purpose of the
tubes connected to their backs?"</p>
<p>"These are part of a circulation system. It’s not just for delivering
nutrients and removing waste; it also circulates other substances.
However, most of the nutrient delivery and waste removal are handled by
GMW, not solely by this circulation system," explained Norton.</p>
<p>"These containers are essentially large chrono fridges," Norton
continued. "In our terms, a body inside might only experience a few
seconds, even though a year passes outside."</p>
<p>"Why not make it a thousand years outside to just a few seconds
inside, so they wouldn’t need any nutrients?" I asked further.</p>
<p>"The greater the difference in time between the inside and outside of
a chrono fridge, the more energy is required. Additionally, the
equipment would need to be significantly larger and the system would
become less stable," Norton explained.</p>
<p>Later, we encountered even larger chrono fridges, equipped with
opaque walls and virtual 3D screens that displayed the scenes inside.
"The images you see are processed for clarity," Wentai explained.
"Inside the chrono fridge, time moves much faster than outside; tens of
thousands of years could pass inside, while only a few hours pass
outside."</p>
<p>"What’s the purpose of accelerating time inside these fridges?" I
inquired.</p>
<p>"The main goal is to observe the natural evolutionary processes of
organisms," Norton elaborated. "For example, we can study the evolution
of viruses over tens of thousands of years or see how the human form
might evolve into a more efficient structure. This helps us refine our
own methods of manufacturing bodies, as we frequently do with bodies
modeled on those from Earth."</p>
<p>Wentai added, "For viruses, bacteria, and other organisms, observing
their life and evolutionary processes within these chrono fridges
greatly benefits our biological research on Guoker Planet."</p>
<p>“In addition, our computers often use chrono fridges. Calculation
results that would normally take ten thousand years to obtain can now be
obtained in just a few minutes by placing the computer in the chrono
fridge.”</p>
<p>He also mentioned, "Here we have relatively few storage containers
compared to our body replication factory on Guoker Planet, where the
numbers are vastly greater."</p>
<p>Willie, holding my hand and with a tone of pride, said, "This
facility is mainly for experimental purposes. Later, I’ll take you to
the Guoker body replication factory, which is incredibly large and will
truly amaze you, Qian. Let’s head back now; there isn’t much else to see
here, just a few bodies in medicinal solution."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-24---visiting-guoker-cloning-factory">Chapter 24 -
Visiting Guoker Cloning Factory</h2>
<p>It was in a morning Willie told me: "Qian, I said to take you for a
visit to our cloning factory once. Norton sent me message on GIW saying
he has a business trip to the cloning factory, and you can be with us
this time. Let’s go then?"</p>
<p>"OK I agree."</p>
<p>Willie pressed her ear and informed Norton through the GIW neural
link. Not for long, Norton and Suldair teleported through GMW to the
virtual sofa at Willie’s home.</p>
<p>Norton asked: "We’re going to the cloning factory. Can you go with
us?"</p>
<p>I asked: "I’m good. Now?"</p>
<p>"We need to wait for a while. The manager of the cloning factory,
whose name is Jarpen, hasn’t been there yet. He’ll give me message as
soon as he arrives." Norton answered.</p>
<p>I asked curiously: "What is a cloning factory? Is that a factory for
building manikins? What material do they use, say plastic?"</p>
<p>"Ho-ho, see what’s in your brain!" Suldair laughed, "The Guoker
Cloning Factory is the largest and most important factory on this
planet. It replicates live human body."</p>
<p>Willie proudly added: "You Earth people always want to be immortal,
and they search for medicine of immortality. Such medicine never exists
in the Universe at all. Every time when our bodies turn old and sick, we
can change to a younger body with our mind preserved. So are us Guoker
People immortal and forever young!"</p>
<p>I didn’t think Willie told the truth: "Then would you still be you
after changing the body?"</p>
<p>Norton answered: "Of course yes! Consciousness is the main difference
between people, the body is relatively not important. We Guoker people
view ourselves consisted of two parts, the mind and the body. The
consciousness mind is a form of movement in human brain, and it is
essentially a kind of information. The body is like your Earth computer
hardware, for instance screen, processor, keyboard, mouse, cassette tape
recorder etc. Mind is like computer software, program and the sound
recorded in cassette tapes.</p>
<p>"When somebody gets old or severely ill, we scan the brain with
artificial field scanning and copy the mind consciousness into data
stored in computer. Then we build a body without consciousness and
install the mind data into the artificially made brain. Finally we
neutralize the old body so the young body becomes functional and the
entirety of the mind consciousness can be transferred. People feel like
waking up from a sleep that the body becomes new. We can do this over
again to make us immortal, and the cloning factory is exactly doing this
job."</p>
<p>Willie asked: "Did you understand, Qian?"</p>
<p>"Oh I understand. It’s like repairing bicycle tires on Earth.
Normally we patch up the tire unless it’s too damaged, then we change a
new one. You’re like if you’re too old or too sick to be healed, you
give up the old body and change a new one, but your consciousness will
stay, right?"</p>
<p>"Ah yes." Willie answered.</p>
<p>This time, Norton pressed his ear maybe because he received GIW
message, and he said: "Jarpen has arrived at the factory. Let’s
move."</p>
<p>We teleported to the cloning factory by GMW. It was an enormous
building, I couldn’t see its end. There were virtual texts above the
gate.</p>
<p>"What a big one!" I was surprised.</p>
<p>Suldair disagreed: "Nothing particular, this is just one of the many
gates."</p>
<p>The gate was just a passageway, there were many other huge buildings
inside as well as virtual buildings. We got on a convertible car
floating about two meters (6.6 feet) above ground and hovering
soundlessly. It was a beautiful scenery here, I saw lots of strange
plants and colorful flowers. There were lots of 3D holograms, all
buildings have virtual Guoker texts at front.</p>
<p>Norton got off the car for a meeting with Jarpen at a building, we
continued our excursion. We moved around for a long time, I exclaimed:
"The cloning factory is so huge!"</p>
<p>Suldair disagreed: "You didn’t see even one percent of the complex
yet!"</p>
<p>"There’s also the underground part." Willie said.</p>
<p>We’ve hanging around for quite a while before we entered a particular
large structure. Some people were walking inside, but not much. Suldair
said Norton was right inside, so we got off, and we meet Norton and
Jarpen there.</p>
<p>Jarpen was also one meter tall (3.3 feet). He was strong, and he held
my hand tight in a very friendly manner.</p>
<p>"Welcome, Qian from Earth! Whoa you’re a big one, you should be very
powerful. Let me see how heavy you are!" Jarpen tried to lift me up from
behind, "That’s indeed a heavy body."</p>
<p>Jarpen looked at me, then at Willie and said: "Qian is very big. So
when you two have sex, how could you stand it? Who’s stronger and more
powerful, and more endurable?"</p>
<p>He might think I didn’t understand, so he made his left hand a
circle, poked his right hand finger into it, and pushed and pulled
violently. This was quite an obscene metaphor to describe the sex
between Willie and me.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! You talk shit!" Willie was quite annoyed by Jarpen, she
swung her hands forcefully into the air in a V shape.</p>
<p>"Nonsense? No way!" Jarpen stepped back and looked at us in a strange
way: "You paid such a long trip to get Qian from Earth, wasn’t that for
studying the sex between Earth and Guoker people? Norton, isn’t that you
who gather all the useful data by observing them?"</p>
<p>Norton was silent, and Willie turned her face around and walked away.
Norton, Suldair and I followed her.</p>
<p>I thought Jarpen was trying to hint me. Norton must be planning
another special experiment with me, I suppose. I’m about to be the
guinea pig again!</p>
<p>Jarpen saw us all ignored him, so he could only follow up and said:
"Let me introduce our cloning factory to you, Qian."</p>
<p>Jarpen enthusiastically introduced me all kinds of equipment and
functions of the cloning factory. His body movements were diverse,
making all kinds of gestures while he spoke. I wasn’t in the mood of
listening though, hoping to see the big naked full-figured woman body I
last saw in the yellow liquid at the Guoker biology research
institute.</p>
<p>Finally at the underground part of the cloning factory, I saw that
kind of naked woman soaked in light-yellow liquid. They have a pipe
connecting to the outside. There were rows after rows of them, similar
in size of about one meter tall (3.3 feet), not like those strange body
types of all varieties at the biology institute.</p>
<p>Jarpen said: "These are the backup bodies on our Guoker Planet. Once
anybody needs a new one, we pick it out from here. You see that have
pipes connecting to the outside, that’s for nutrition supply and
removing waste."</p>
<p>I asked: "Why don’t you use GMW to do that, just like you did it to
your living body?"</p>
<p>"We do use GMW to teleport nutrition and waste, but the pipes are
also part of their circulation system. We still need to design a
circulation system to keep the bodies alive, we must not entirely depend
on GMW to do the job. Because this might wake up the consciousness of
these backup bodies, as they acquire blank minds like plants." Jarpen
explained.</p>
<p>I still had many questions: "Why you have similar size to the backup
bodies instead of making larger and smaller ones? That may satisfy some
people."</p>
<p>Jarpen answered: "First, it is more convenient for us to manufacture,
just like you Earth. You build products in the same size to make them
cheaper and more reliable; building different sizes will be more
complicated. This is of course also a tradition of us Guoker people. You
see this size, which has been studied and experimented for a long time,
and we made the conclusion that such body size is the best suitable for
the gravity and physical and chemical environment of the Guoker Planet.
It’s the best for living, sporting, sexing and immunity.</p>
<p>"There’s another important reason: people with too big of a size
could hurt those smaller people. On our Guoker Planet, we have no
morality and law, so sex is sometimes violent and brutal. It’s a wise
choice to control from the source of the problem - body size, to
regulate people instead of by morality and law. However, while we
control the body size strictly on the main star of the Guoker System, on
other planets however, people have a variety of choice of body sizes, so
we see all kinds of weird bodies.</p>
<p>"You, Qian, so big, enter such a small body of Willie, should be
strictly forbidden on Guoker Planet!" Jarpen didn’t care about what
Willie thinks, he pointed at Willie’s groin.</p>
<p>Willie jumped away and ran next to me, hugged my arm and showed she
was happy about my size. To divert the conversation from the sex topic,
I asked Willie: "How many backup bodies do you have on Guoker
Planet?"</p>
<p>"Some millions I suppose?" Willie answered.</p>
<p>"Then how many cloning factories do you have on Guoker Planet?"</p>
<p>"Only one." Jarpen said, "Body replicating is the most important task
on Guoker Planet, It’s impossible for us not to take it seriously."</p>
<p>"On our Earth, the age of 18 is our golden age. If you build a backup
body, do you need 18 years?"</p>
<p>Norton answered: "We have the chrono fridge, we can do that quicker
than you thought."</p>
<p>"You know what chrono fridge is?" Jarpen wanted to explain.</p>
<p>"I knew that by visiting that biological research institute." I
replied.</p>
<p>As we walked, I came across another question: "Whenever an old person
come to your cloning factory and change to a new one, if his old body
wasn’t dealt with, could he feel two ‘himselves’ and, where does his old
body go?"</p>
<p>Jarpen answered: "Simple. We neutralize them. Otherwise there’re
indeed two ‘myselves’."</p>
<p>I didn’t quite get it: "What you mean by neutralize?"</p>
<p>Suldair laughed out violently: "It’s killing you, then incinerate
you, Ho-hoho!"</p>
<p>Willie condemned: "You need to have something charming in your brain.
You have too many frightening words."</p>
<p>"So can I have my Earth body replicated here?"</p>
<p>Jarpen answered clearly: "You’re Earth human, we don’t have the
computer program to do this. It will take a very long time to develop
the program. Also, although we have no law regulating individuals, we
have strong regulations towards organizations, AI and all algorithms.
The cloning factory is not allowed to casually replicate all alien
bodies. This is a factory, not a research facility. Research labs can do
this under certain regulation and control."</p>
<p>I commented: "You cannot replicate me, so I doubt if I cannot have
two ‘myselves’ in the Universe, and your replicas of human body might
not be the original people. They come to your factory only to get
themselves killed and incinerated, then you casually build another one
and say, presto, the cloning is successful!"</p>
<p>"Your comments made me angry!" Jarpen rushed towards me and wanted to
attack me. He stopped just as he was about to hit my body.</p>
<p>"I have a program allowing you to experience two myselves." he
said.</p>
<p>Jarpen lead us to quite a small room. He turned on the GIW virtual
screen and operated for a while, then something like a helmet appeared.
Jarpen asked me to wear it.</p>
<p>I indeed felt something unbelievable. I felt myself in the room
talking to Jarpen, Norton, Willie and Suldair, then suddenly I was
outside the room watching myself talking to them.</p>
<p>I took of the helmet and said: "That was amazing. I really felt two
of myselves, so I believe your cloning factory is sound and honest now.
I have another question, how do you Guoker people choose your own backup
body?"</p>
<p>"Our backup bodies at the cloning factory are mainly from pure
artificial manufacturing, others are from natural reproduction. When
they’re mature, we post it on GIW instantly. The Guoker people search on
GIW for their bodies, or they can design or customize their bodies in a
restricted scale, even sometimes by the comments of their friends."</p>
<p>"Aha, it’s like we Earth people buy clothes! I’m a man, can I choose
a woman’s body?"</p>
<p>Norton answered: "It is exceedingly painful for people who has their
body and mind in mismatch. This is normally not allowed, the cloning
factory cannot satisfy such kind of idea."</p>
<p>"Although you Guoker people have advanced body replicating
technology, I find a serious question. If you ever come across any
accidents, like falling down the hill, you should be over if you fail to
clone yourself in time?"</p>
<p>Norton answered: "This... we have a different concept of death
compared with you Earth people. Suppose a Guoker astronaut fly to your
Earth to explore, then he will be storing his knowledge and memories
into the computer before he left. If the astronaut pass away on Earth,
we will install his mind onto the backup immediately to resurrect
him.</p>
<p>"Then he talks to others and say, unfortunately my memory of the
Earth trip was lost. So death is just losing a part of our memories for
us Guoker people, as we preserve the most of them in backup. On this
planet, GMW and GIW can track everybody and record their mind
simultaneously, so everybody lose none of their memories should they
have accidents."</p>
<p>"Can you alter people’s mind when you replicate their body?"</p>
<p>Norton answered: "We have multiple large biological research
institutes. The Guoker people have stronger, prettier, better designed,
ever perfected bodies generations after generations. We often study body
structures on other planets in order to build better backup bodies in
service of our people. However in the cloning factory, we respect
people’s mind and consciousness and we never alter any of them.</p>
<p>"Unless in some special bio research labs, there are some special
reasonable demands, so mind can be altered partially under regulated and
supervised condition, for instance for people having mental suffering.
In early times as we just invented artificial field scanning to copy
people’s minds and store them in computer, it was very easy to alter
them, so we did that quite a lot, but it caused huge negative side
effects. Later we invented a concept called Personal Source Code, so in
some conditions people’s mind and memory data can be restored to the
original."</p>
<p>I asked: "How long does it take to scan and record a person’s
mind?"</p>
<p>"It’s pretty quick, about six seven minutes to your Earth time."
Norton replied.</p>
<p>"If I customized myself a new body, do I need to tell my relatives
and friends beforehand so they can still recognize me afterwards? Is
that possible?" I asked.</p>
<p>Jarpen explained: "It is possible, but you only need to tell your
friends. We Guoker people have no relatives, no parents and siblings. We
can always change our body one after the other, and our bodies are
manufactured by ourselves, where the heck are our relatives coming
from?"</p>
<p>"Do people pay for the new body? Or do they cost anything to
build?"</p>
<p>Suldair teased: "It’s for free. You Earth people always think about
money."</p>
<p>Norton answered: "If this needs to be paid, how would those people
think if they cannot afford it? That will cause chaos to the society. At
least on Guoker Planet, body replicating is for free."</p>
<p>After the visit, my mind was overwhelmed: "We Earth people dreamed
about immortality for countless generations. I don’t know how many
hundreds or thousands of years shall we wait for body replicating
technology."</p>
<p>Jarpen answered: "You need to have confidence. If you Earth people
have the confidence, and understand the core of a person is mind
consciousness that mind consciousness is a form of movement of charged
particles in the brain, which is a kind of information, plus if you have
artificial field scanning technology, you can do that in mere
decades.</p>
<p>"But the most crucial problem for you Earth people is to know the
essence of field. Only by achieving this, you can use this kind of
intangible element of the Universe to dig deep inside the brain and
record human consciousness data. Aside from the field, all other things
will damage the human brain as long as they enter it. For example, you
Earth people can manage photons, electromagnetic field, ultrasonic waves
and X-ray. But all of them will damage the brain if they enter deep into
it, killing the person. Why would you record anything by killing people?
Aside from recording, installing mind into body backup also needs
artificial field, and nothing else can replace it.</p>
<p>"You need to first decipher the essence of field on Earth, then
develop a technology for artificial field scanning. While controlled by
computer program, it can be called artificial information field. It is
the artificial information field which records consciousness deep in the
brain and install it to the new brain. Designing the artificial field
control software needs many genius mathematicians."</p>
<p>Norton added: "It is also important for you to know the direction of
solving the problem. The core of a person is mind consciousness, a
movement form of charged particles in the brain, essentially a kind of
information. Mind consciousness activities can disrupt the surrounding
space to make it into a wave form. This wave form of space moves at the
speed of light, so it is crucial to record the space wave form and the
brain charged particles’ movement form.</p>
<p>"The body is a vehicle for mind consciousness, which is relatively
not important. You Earth people always think the body is more important
and mind is less important, so you always think of healing the body,
like inventing medicines to keep the body young or freezing the body for
preservation. These methods can never help you to reach immortality. If
you go the wrong direction, you’ll never succeed."</p>
<p>Suldair commented impolitely: "Qian, you Earth people spend the most
money on drugs, tobacco and alcohol, and secondly on weapons to kill
each other. You Earth people think others who dedicate themselves to
science research are either stupid or crazy. My analysis is that you
Earth people will not have scientific advancement in the future, and
you’ll lose your progress instead, because all your true scientists are
already dead. You don’t have scientists now, you only have simple minded
technicians as scientists.</p>
<p>"Other than war, you only know suppressing, bullying and deceiving
each other. Decades later, you will fall back to the primitive age like
a bunch of monkeys. Human body replicating technology has nothing to do
with you Earth people, not because you aren’t capable of doing it, but
because nobody thinks about it, forever.</p>
<p>"In conclusion, I have no expectation on how Qian would make any
difference on Earth. People would think he’s mentally ill when he
returns to Earth. There’s another feature of the Earth people: whenever
some people do something, others always think of sabotaging it."</p>
<p>Norton said: "I have no expectation either. Immortality is not easy.
Earth people have great inertia in their minds, they’re conservative and
always set up barriers to themselves. Should you Earth people ever
believe in you, Qian, and put into action of all costs, you can be
successful in decades of Earth time once you have artificial field
scanning as a tool.</p>
<p>"Because immortality is realized just by recording mind consciousness
through artificial field scanning. Once the consciousness is stored in
computer, no matter how the body and brain die and perish, the computer
can be easily maintained so the consciousness is never lost. Then people
can wait, no matter how long it takes."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-25---new-humanoid-species-on-guoker-planet">Chapter 25 -
New Humanoid Species on Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>After visiting the cloning factory on Guoker Planet, Norton, Suldair,
and Willie took me to a research center dedicated to developing new
humanoid species. As Guoker people can manufacture their own bodies,
they continually experiment with various unique and bizarre humanoid
forms. Because they can transfer human consciousness from one brain to
another body, it’s easy for them to switch bodies to experience and live
as new humanoid types.</p>
<p>This center was housed in an enormous building; the ceiling was so
high and covered by something, making it unclear. Here, I encountered
numerous unimaginable humanoid species.</p>
<p>One was a shiny black metallic woman whose skin was unusually cold
and elastic. Her body was heavy, providing a unique sensation during
intimacy. The friction inside her body felt like rubbing against fine
sand, delivering a peculiarly satisfying feeling. However, engaging with
her was physically taxing and left a lasting impression on me.</p>
<p>Other metallic humanoids produced sensations as if many tiny needles
were pricking your skin, and some emitted slight electrical currents. I
saw many types of metallic humanoids—silver, lead-gray, and others with
a mercury-like appearance. Some appeared metallic but felt different to
the touch. Many had parts of their skin that transitioned smoothly from
metallic to flesh.</p>
<p>Their faces and eyes were flat, with no indentations, and their black
pupils resembled the uppercase letter “H”. When they looked at you, the
black stripes moved up and down or side to side, creating an oppressive
and terrifying feeling.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/y6XxGPYwi7fu315.jpg" width="338" height="451"></p>
<p>I also witnessed several lean women with green skin practicing high
jumps. Their jumping ability was astonishing; they would squat on the
ground like frogs and then spring up rapidly, reaching heights many
times their own stature. Norton approached and spoke with them briefly,
after which one of them stormed towards me with the fierceness of a
boxer accepting a challenge.</p>
<p>As she came closer, I could see that she was about one meter tall,
completely naked. Her skin was a pale green on the front and a deep,
rich green on her back, darker than that of any frog, with her armpits
and groin area being a very light green, almost white. The colors on her
body transitioned smoothly and naturally.</p>
<p>Her entire body was extremely smooth and shiny, like a meticulously
polished piece of jade. She was exceedingly lean; apart from her head,
the thickest part of her body was no wider than my arm. Her waist was
extremely slender, her breasts long and thin, and the crease of her
groin was hidden between her legs, completely invisible when she
stood.</p>
<p>Kevin cautioned me that this woman belonged to a species capable of
disassembling their body and that she possessed a very high energy
level. He advised me to be cautious.</p>
<p>As this lean woman neared me, she suddenly sprung up like a coiled
spring, her legs wrapping around my waist as she slid her body down.
When my penis entered her, it was immediately gripped by an overwhelming
force. At the same time, her arms and legs locked my body tightly, and I
felt meat tubes penetrating my urethra and anus.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth wide, and meat tubes from her mouth extended
into my body, filling me with a strong, pungent odor that was difficult
to endure. However, I was immobilized by her grip, unable to move. I had
encountered this situation several times before, but this time was
different as the meat tubes in her lower body snapped off inside my
urethra and anus, leaving fragments inside me. Subsequently, her body
shrank and started to enter my body from my mouth, making me feel as
though I was swallowing live eels or catfish.</p>
<p>Normally, I could gradually become accustomed to the smell and even
start to like it, as women from the Guoker galaxy are adept at using
their body odor to control men. However, this time, the pungent odor
grew increasingly intense, and my willpower was almost entirely consumed
by it, leaving me unable to resist as her body entered mine. Eventually,
her entire body moved inside me and began sliding towards my lower body.
The segments of meat tubes left in my anus and urethra caused immense
pressure in my abdomen and urethra, providing a profound sense of
pleasure.</p>
<p>At that moment, my only thought was that the meat tubes must not slip
out. If they did, the pressure would dissipate, and the extraordinary
pleasure would vanish. Yet I was powerless to prevent it. The pressure
in my abdomen, accompanied by intense pleasure, was unfortunately
short-lived as the meat tubes eventually fell from my anus and landed on
the ground. Her disassembled body, resembling green leeches, spewed from
my anus along with a yellow, sticky fluid. The meat tubes from my
urethra also fell out, accompanied by a similar fluid and small, soft
spheres, culminating in an extreme climax. It felt as if an extremely
silky substance was passing through my urethra and anus, and I was
utterly powerless to stop it.</p>
<p>The green, leech-like pieces on the ground, curved at both ends, were
dark green on the back and white on the belly, coated in a pale yellow
sticky fluid. Gradually, they merged back into their original human form
and stood up, leaving a large, glistening puddle of yellow fluid on the
ground.</p>
<p>Heres the revised version of your translation, adjusted for natural
English expression while staying true to the original content and
style:</p>
<p>Then, a pink-skinned woman approached, her body glistening like a
piece of translucent pink jade. As we embraced, she rubbed her body
against mine with force. As a result, her body heated up and softened,
eventually melting and entering my body through my mouth.</p>
<p>Inside, it felt as though countless tiny hands were gently caressing
me, eliciting a unique sensation of pleasure. Later, a considerable
amount of sticky pink liquid began to flow from my urethra and anus.
This liquid was so viscous that it stretched into long pink threads
before finally gathering on the ground and reforming into the womans
original shape.</p>
<p>Other encounters involved women who could disintegrate into minuscule
droplets, seeping out like sweat from the skin of my lower body. These
droplets would fall to the ground and then slowly reassemble into their
original form. I also met several women with high energy levels who
leaped towards me like frogs, clamping their legs around my waist or
head. When they gripped my waist, they would gradually slide their
bodies down so that my penis entered them. In most cases, they clamped
their legs around my head, and the flesh of their lower body would
suddenly split open, forming a triangular cavity with a main meat tube
at the apex.</p>
<p>Their flesh would quickly envelop my face tightly. Unlike Earth women
who focus on the male penis, their interest lay in the inner cavities of
a mans body. Perhaps they assumed my internal anatomy was similar to
that of Guoker men—a simple cavity.</p>
<p>Usually, I only saw flashes of crimson, purple-red, or glossy black
before my face was covered, leaving me unable to see or breathe.
Sometimes, their groin flesh sparkled with blue or other colored specks,
reminiscent of stars twinkling in a dark sky.</p>
<p>Guoker men typically utilize GMW technology to remotely supply their
blood with oxygen, reducing their reliance on lungs except for
vocalization. They are unconcerned about their faces being covered.
However, the women who engaged with me did not realize that, as an
Earthling, I constantly need to breathe. Often, I had to forcibly pry
open a gap in the flesh covering my face just to breathe. Over time, on
their planet, I noticed I suffered no discomfort from being suffocated
repeatedly—perhaps they had learned to supply me remotely with oxygen
through GMW, making the situation more bearable for me.</p>
<p>Once these women securely locked onto my head, their groin meat tubes
would aggressively and swiftly extend into my mouth, forcefully
traveling down to my stomach. Initially, the sensation was nauseating,
but they would then eject a viscous liquid that significantly alleviated
the discomfort. As the meat tubes reached my intestines, they would
expel even more of this sticky substance. Being quite small, they often
required additional liquid from GMW, as their bodies could not contain
much. The vast amount of liquid they could produce was several times
their body weight, creating intense pressure in my abdomen and a
profound sense of pleasure that radiated throughout my body.</p>
<p>Eventually, I lost control over my anus, and the sticky liquid would
uncontrollably squirt out, feeling incredibly silky. No matter how hard
I tried, I couldnt stop the flow. Sometimes, the viscous liquid would
also shoot out from my urethra. The combined sensation from both areas
would bring me to an intense climax.</p>
<p>As their meat pipes entered through my mouth and exited my anus, they
would tighten and harden, becoming probing tentacles that searched my
lower body. When they found my penis, they would instantly wrap around
and burrow inside. The head of these tentacles would violently shake,
often causing pain and injury. If a tentacle successfully penetrated,
the ones wrapped around the outside would constrict tightly while those
inside would expand, creating a brutal squeezing and pulling motion that
often left my urethra bleeding and in pain. Even if there were no
injuries, the aftermath always felt like a burning sensation. The
tentacles would eject a hot, spicy liquid inside me, initially masking
the pain but leaving lingering discomfort.</p>
<p>We visited the New Humanoid Species Center several times and observed
various hybrid species that were part human, part animal. Some resembled
a combination of humans with snakes, eels, or fish, while others looked
more like insects, snails, octopuses, or leeches. Some individuals
looked like jelly or jade, and others were covered in thick, shiny
fur—an exotic array!</p>
<p>Norton explained, "Many of these species are eventually phased out,
and only a few have gained popularity within the Guoker System. The main
challenge in developing new species is ensuring a harmonious alignment
between their cognitive functions and physical forms. We conduct
numerous experiments and also utilize supercomputers for
simulations."</p>
<p>Despite the vast differences in appearance, size, and weight among
Guoker women, most share a common feature: numerous meat pipes concealed
within their groins. These pipes can extend rapidly and retract just as
quickly, and its typical for them to discharge a sticky liquid several
times their body weight.</p>
<p>They possess a primary pipe, their main instrument for assaulting
men, and they handle it with ease. Given that their bodies are
self-designed, it seems that storing meat pipes in the groin is a trend
within the Guoker System. These pipes vary greatly in size—some are
thicker than my own body, while others are as thin as threads. They come
in various colors: purple-red, dark red, pink, light cyan, black, white,
and transparent, some even bearing patterns reminiscent of venomous
snakes, which can be quite startling. Most are glossy and slick, some
glow in the dark, others are covered in bristly barbs, and a few even
conduct electricity.</p>
<p>Once, I endured an assault by one of these barbed meat pipes. Before
the penetration, my body was filled with a lubricant resembling jelly or
butter, making the insertion relatively smooth. However, the extraction
was agonizing, leaving me in a cold sweat as my intestines felt as if
they were on fire, and I collapsed, unable to stand, as blood trailed
out.</p>
<p>Guoker women, regardless of their size, exuded an overwhelming
physical strength, operating like high-powered engines. Their fierceness
and abnormal endurance during intercourse, with its rapid and relentless
pace, were too much for me to handle. The sight of them lined up,
gripping their meat pipes eagerly as they faced me, triggered an
instinctive fear.</p>
<p>Norton had warned me during my first encounter to only allow one
persons meat pipe to enter my body and to quickly cover my mouth or anus
to prevent others from doing the same. I ignored his warning and paid
the price. Once, I faced four of them; as they extended their meat pipes
towards me, one targeted my anus and another my mouth. Initially, it
seemed manageable, but as they began to pull in opposite directions, the
internal agony was like my organs were being torn apart, nearly
unbearable.</p>
<p>Entering through my mouth brought a potent, nauseating stench, while
entering through my anus pushed feces towards my mouth, equally
revolting. The moments of insertion and withdrawal were the most
distressing, with the fear heightened when their meat pipes occasionally
pierced through my intestines and protruded from my abdomen. The
extraction was excruciating.</p>
<p>When first penetrated, I pleaded with them to slow down, and
sometimes they complied. However, once they entered a state of intense
excitement, evident when they opened their mouths and closed their eyes,
no amount of pleading, crying, or moaning made any difference. They
showed no regard for my suffering, continuing their frenzied motions
without concern for my well-being. They had no empathy for the weak;
when I was at my limit, curling up and groaning, they only seemed
exhilarated, completely indifferent to my pain.</p>
<p>Their appearance alone—dissolute, audacious, wild, and fierce—could
be intimidating, and none showed signs of kindness or sadness. Immortal
and fearless of death, they had no respect or appreciation for life.
Unburdened by work, family responsibilities, or societal norms, and free
from any legal, familial, or marital constraints, they behaved
recklessly.</p>
<p>Their only approach to strangers was brutal: "To fuck you to death!"
Without the protection of Norton and the GMW, I might have actually been
killed. They seemed more like heartless animals than sentient beings.
Facing several of them as they simultaneously penetrated me with their
meat pipes was both terrifying and despairing.</p>
<p>What Nortons team found most distressing was the aftermath of my
encounters with Guoker women. They would heal my physical injuries with
artificial field scanning and either delete or alter my painful
memories. Consequently, each time I faced another sexual encounter, my
memories were pleasantly distorted, reducing my fear. Only in moments of
extreme pain did I realize the true agony of the experience.</p>
<p>Expecting sexual interaction with a Guoker woman often started with a
fleeting moment of pleasure, swiftly followed by intolerable pain,
leading me to wish fervently for it to end or to lose consciousness,
only to wake up relieved that it was finally over.</p>
<p>Whenever I complained about the Guoker women and these new species,
Nortons team would invariably criticize Earthlings for having fragile
bodies, showing no intention of sparing me from these sexual encounters.
They pointed out that the Guoker System housed many types of women, and
that I had only encountered a few. They insisted I engage sexually with
each of the more typical and representative species to collect necessary
data.</p>
<p>Eventually, Norton presented a three-dimensional hologram and asked
me to choose a species.</p>
<p>I selected a woman whose body resembled jelly but bore a human-like
figure, quiet and beautiful in appearance. I assumed she wouldnt be too
troublesome.</p>
<p>However, meeting her in person differed from the holographic image.
Her body was translucent, resembling white jade or a snails, with a
vaguely visible black interior.</p>
<p>She stood naked on a pristine, finely crafted bed. Under their
orders, I approached and she embraced me. Her body was extremely soft
and chillingly cold, giving me goosebumps as if I were being embraced by
a giant leech.</p>
<p>She crawled up my body like a leech and eventually detached from the
bed, winding around me. As she maneuvered over my shoulder to my back,
her groin reached my mouth and suddenly burst open, revealing a
horrifying array of shiny black tentacles.</p>
<p>She was boneless and exceedingly pliable, gradually engulfing me
completely, starting from my head. As she consumed me, I watched through
a video feed provided by GIW customer service. I appeared to morph into
a larger version of her. I touched myself, feeling as though I were
touching a womans body, complete with breasts and a vagina, but it felt
like touching a real human woman, not the gel-like substance from
before.</p>
<p>Later, she injected a substance like molten butter into my mouth. It
was slick and swiftly passed through my stomach to my intestines. I felt
an uncontrollable urge to defecate. Thinking about the cleanliness of
the place, I tried desperately to hold it in, lying down in hopes of
gaining control. Despite my efforts, I was unable to contain it and
ended up soiling extensively. Though I couldnt see clearly from within
her body, the GIW footage showed the extent of the mess.</p>
<p>At the moment we separated, I glimpsed the disaster we had made of
the bed. Shortly afterward, GMW teleported me back to Willie’s
residence. I felt deeply embarrassed, and my mind even wandered to the
idea of inventing something akin to a diaper for such situations.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-26---segregation-policy-on-guoker-planet">Chapter 26 -
Segregation Policy on Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>Norton, Suldair, and Willie once took me to a peculiar space, still
within their home planet, but markedly different. It was a dimly lit
area where the sky perpetually bore the hue of a cloudy, gray day.</p>
<p>Kevin explained, “This is actually an illusion. Both GMW and GIW
create this illusion in anyone who enters this area. It serves as a
warning that this place harbors individuals with criminal
tendencies.”</p>
<p>The Guokers do not rely on morality or law to curb crime; instead,
they use the instant teleportation capability of GMW. For instance, if
someone attempts murder, the highly intelligent network detects the
threat and instantly teleports the individuals apart, thwarting the
crime. However, some criminals employ deceit to commit sexual assaults.
Once physical contact is made, the entanglement of their organs makes it
impossible for the network to separate them.</p>
<p>Moreover, some criminals possess advanced techniques to block,
disrupt, or deceive GMW. They might inflict pain while making the victim
appear outwardly pleased, or inject toxins that cause severe pain after
a delay, thus fooling GMW. Nevertheless, the sophisticated systems of
GMW and GIW eventually evaluate these criminals actions comprehensively.
Persistent offenders causing significant harm are relocated to
specialized zones. Those who refuse to stay within these areas and evade
to other regions end up blacklisted, losing access to network services,
which severely restricts their capabilities and makes further crimes
nearly impossible.”</p>
<p>“This space you’ve entered,” Kevin continued, “is a hub for venomous
women known for their aggressive tendencies towards men. They
collaborate, sharing research on various toxins, continually innovating
from generation to generation. Their expertise in utilizing these
poisons is unparalleled, and they thrive on their craft.”</p>
<p>As we ventured into the area, Norton and his team soon identified a
target and pushed me forward as bait, while they hid. Approaching the
woman, I observed her child-like features; her body and face were
exquisitely delicate, and she was dressed in a tight T-shirt paired with
a shimmering, metallic-string miniskirt. Her skin was a pale pink tinged
with dark cyan, and her hair, glossy and black, fell smoothly like
rubber tubes. Clearly, she belonged to the more docile kind.</p>
<p>On our Planet, there are two predominant female physiques. The first
is the "smooth kind," characterized by an extremely delicate and
symmetrical body, smooth and naturally falling hair, long, slender
breasts, and neatly arranged, smooth, downward-hanging groin tubes in
vibrant, pure colors. The woman I encountered belonged to this type.</p>
<p>The other style is the "brutal kind," marked by small hands and feet,
a very slim waist contrasted with a voluptuous figure. Their breasts are
short and large, resembling two big spheres, and their hips are equally
ample. Their hair explodes in wild disarray. The tubes from their lower
body are tangled and chaotic, resembling wildly dancing snakes, and
their multicolored patterns are reminiscent of Earths cobras and other
venomous snakes, striking fear at a glance.</p>
<p>This woman walked expressionlessly until she saw me, her eyes
flashing a mischievous glint, perhaps intrigued by my large and unique
appearance. Guokerian women have a pronounced predilection for sexually
assaulting men, especially those who look unusual, and they rarely pass
up such an opportunity.</p>
<p>However, she suddenly ran away—had I misunderstood her intentions? I
later realized that her interest was indeed sexual, but her flight was
not to find a secluded place for an encounter. In this peculiar zone,
these women, once they fixate on a man, might initiate an assault right
on the street, oblivious to onlookers. They can even request GMW and GIW
to erect a virtual barrier around them, rendering them invisible to
others.</p>
<p>Norton later explained that her quick departure was to squat down and
concentrate, channeling the toxins in her body into the main tube in her
groin. She might also have been requesting a remote toxin refill from
GMW. She then approached me again, feigning nonchalance.</p>
<p>By Earth standards, she was strikingly beautiful with an
exceptionally fine face. She styled herself to appear vulnerable and
endearingly cute, but her large eyes conveyed a cold, hidden ferocity,
reminiscent of the intense gaze shared between two expert duelists in a
film. Her gaze was sharp and resolute, whereas I felt timid and
frightened. On Earth, the thoughts surrounding a first sexual encounter
typically focus on mutual pleasure. However, on Guoker, the intent is
often to inflict torture and pain, mixing agony with pleasure—an aspect
I had already learned from multiple harsh encounters, particularly with
women who harbored a penchant for aggression and abuse.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to pass each other, she made her move. She
crouched suddenly, then sprang into the air like a frog, her virtual
clothes vanishing instantly. Her body, gleaming like white jade, hurtled
toward me. The main tube from her groin shot out at lightning speed,
tracing a radiant arc through the air, and swiftly expelled a stream of
transparent liquid that hit my abdomen and the base of my penis. I
shuddered, my head spinning as darkness encroached my vision, and a
searing liquid quickly permeated my belly and groin.</p>
<p>I suspect the fluid she expelled was a type of neural toxin designed
to prevent my penis from becoming erect, to short-circuit my brain, and
temporarily impair my ability to think and control my body. On this
planet, men can instantly request help from GMW if they sense that a
woman may be prone to aggressive sexual behavior, thwarting any
potential assault. To be successful, these women need to act not only
quickly but also skillfully employ toxins, akin to cowboys who must draw
their guns swiftly and shoot accurately to prevail.</p>
<p>Her sudden toxin spray aims to incapacitate the man’s mental
faculties, causing him to forget to summon GMW for assistance and
struggle to control his own movements. This disorientation allows the
woman to easily insert her meat pipe into the man as a next step. After
releasing the toxin, their actions slow down to prolong the torment.
They rapidly insert their meat pipe into the man, making it difficult
for him to call for GMW assistance once entangled, as their bodies are
intertwined, and only a sophisticated, remotely initiated program might
separate them.</p>
<p>This toxin is potent; I experienced its effects several times. Once,
when they targeted my penis with the toxin, I instinctively dodged, but
my right thigh was hit, rendering it instantly powerless. After striking
me with the toxin, she leapt up, clamping my neck between her legs at
lightning speed. Her groin clamped over my face, and several meat pipes
quickly forced their way into my mouth. It seemed her interest wasn’t in
my penis, but rather in exploiting the cavities within my body. All I
could see was a flash of shiny black before my vision was obscured and I
was unable to breathe. Desperately, I pried open a gap between her flesh
with my hands to draw breath.</p>
<p>Then, dozens of her meat pipes wrapped around my head, aggressively
extending into my mouth and down my throat into my stomach.</p>
<p>The revulsion was overwhelming, and I couldn’t stop myself from
retching. Her meat pipes then secreted a viscous liquid that
significantly alleviated my nausea.</p>
<p>This time, once her tentacles penetrated my abdomen, she slowed her
movements, allowing her meat pipes to wander, twitch, and rub inside me
leisurely.</p>
<p>I later felt an increased secretion of the sticky liquid in my
intestines. The volume of liquid created intense pressure but also a
profound sense of pleasure that spread from my abdomen throughout my
body.</p>
<p>They can request GMW to instantaneously transfer large quantities of
this liquid into their bodies from afar, enabling them to eject several
times their body weight in fluid.</p>
<p>The pressure from this liquid was immense, eventually overwhelming my
ability to control it, and it began to seep out, running down my
legs.</p>
<p>One of her meat pipes followed the flow of the liquid, emerging from
my anus and winding around my abdomen and thighs. When it touched my
penis, it quickly coiled around it and then proceeded to invade my
urethra.</p>
<p>My penis was in a flaccid state, allowing her meat pipe to easily
penetrate and gradually extend along my urethra, seemingly reaching all
the way to my bladder. Inside my bladder, it roamed freely, sucking
vigorously like a straw.</p>
<p>While its passage through my intestines was less noticeable, the
movement through my urethra was distinctly perceptible. Although I had
experienced multiple intrusions into my urethra by their women’s meat
pipes, this was the first time one had reached my bladder.</p>
<p>Then, she began her mischief. She released venom into my bladder
causing my penis to swell abruptly. The meat pipes around it tightened
forcefully while the one inside my urethra hardened and began to vibrate
rhythmically. This combination of constriction and vibration delivered
an intense mix of pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>Subsequently, she injected more venom into my intestines and stomach,
triggering a variety of hallucinations. I envisioned numerous tiny,
naked mermaids, legless with tadpole-like tails, swimming in through my
mouth and exiting through my anus.</p>
<p>Eventually, it seemed she also reached a climax, rhythmically
ejecting large amounts of sticky fluid into my bladder before slowly
withdrawing from my urethra.</p>
<p>I felt tremendous pressure in my bladder. After her tentacle
retracted, a pale yellow fluid sprayed from my penis. Eventually, my
penis softened, but the sticky fluid continued to drip out for an
extended period, some of it running down my legs where I could see
streaks of blood, though surprisingly, I felt no pain.</p>
<p>Another of her meat pipes retracted into my anus, leaving a trail of
sticky fluid down my legs.</p>
<p>Later, she slowly withdrew several meat pipes from my mouth. After
the sexual encounter ended, she landed gracefully on the ground and
departed leisurely.</p>
<p>Exhausted, I was coated in a pale yellow viscous fluid, much of which
had pooled on the ground, creating a filthy scene. My body felt weak and
powerless, my urethra burned painfully, and the colors of my
surroundings seemed to shift dramatically. Everything appeared covered
in a murky yellow haze, and my vision was blurry.</p>
<p>I blinked hard, trying to restore clarity to my sight, but to no
avail. I attempted to walk towards Norton, but it felt as if I were
stepping on cotton; I couldnt control my balance and was unable to walk
without their assistance.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-27---money-on-guoker-planet">Chapter 27 - Money on
Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>Once, Willie, Norton, Suldair, and I visited a place dubbed as an
entertainment venue. Upon entering, I noticed Willie staring at a wall
which promptly displayed Guoker text; the text vanished as soon as she
moved away.</p>
<p>"What are you looking at?" I asked Willie curiously.</p>
<p>"Im checking my wealth credits on GIW," she replied.</p>
<p>"Wealth credits? Whats that?"</p>
<p>"Its what you Earthlings call money. It’s like checking your bank
balance," Willie explained.</p>
<p>I was puzzled. "Ah! Im surprised. With Guoker Planet being so
advanced, why do you still need money? If you can have anything you
want, why the need for money?"</p>
<p>Norton chimed in, "Although our technology surpasses Earths and what
you need is either trivial or easily accessible to us, we Guokers have
our own needs. These might include requiring services from others or
accessing specific information. Where theres demand, theres trade, and
where theres trade, theres money. Thus, money is indispensable."</p>
<p>"Money also helps in organizing the division of labor in society.
Even civilizations more advanced than ours still use money," added
Suldair.</p>
<p>Willie continued, "On Guoker Planet, money is virtual; we dont use
physical currency like Earths cash. Our money is merely a number on GIW.
Our earnings and expenditures are automatically tracked by GIW, which
manages our transactions. You dont carry cash, and nobody sees the
money; it exists only as a digital figure on GIW. We can also access our
wealth credits through our brains direct link to GIW. Sometimes, to
avoid hassle, we use external computers."</p>
<p>I was still confused. "For instance, if I work for a boss on Earth
and dig a hole..."</p>
<p>Suldair burst into laughter. "Ho-ho-ho! Brother Qian, why do you
always end up digging holes?"</p>
<p>"Its not that I enjoy it," I clarified. "I often dig mud on Earth to
catch ricefield eels, so I end up digging a lot. For instance, if I dig
a hole for a boss on Earth, he pays me in cash. How would that work on
Guoker Planet if theres no physical money?"</p>
<p>"Thats easy!" Willie exclaimed. "You simply log onto GIW, and when
your boss pays you, you can see your wealth credits increase. If your
brain were linked to GIW like ours, youd know immediately."</p>
<p>"But, Brother Qian, youre an Earthling. Although you can link to our
GIW, youre not familiar with it and lack a GIW identity. Thus, you cant
properly receive wealth credits, which complicates things more than they
would be on Earth."</p>
<p>"So, how do Guokers make money?"</p>
<p>"On Guoker Planet," Norton explained, "everyone regularly receives a
fixed amount of wealth credits, sufficient for daily life. However,
earning extra money is challenging. Nearly all financial activities rely
on GMW and GIW. We belong to network protocol tribes formed through GIW.
Willie, Suldair, and I are members of the Studying Earthlings tribe. We
continuously research and study Earthlings, which gives us some
authority on Earth-related matters. This research also helps us earn
wealth credits. We plan to build a physical structure to serve as a
research base and exhibition center for Earth-related items. Once
completed, Willie, Suldair, and I will earn significant wealth credits,
and our virtual address on GIW will allow other Guoker people to visit
and learn virtually. There will be much more people visiting virtually
than actually. If more people come to visit in the future, we can
continue to gain wealth."</p>
<p>"We can start building now. Brother Qian, you can see how we make
money by constructing buildings. Well head back to Willie’s place to
begin our work," we decided. Upon arriving at Willies home via the GMW,
everyone booted up their virtual computers to start.</p>
<p>I was puzzled. "You don’t visit the construction site? How can you
manage everything just from your computers?"</p>
<p>Willie responded elegantly, flipping her left hand palm up, "Simply
by operating through the GIW, we can complete the building. Afterwards,
well all go and check it out."</p>
<p>Norton explained, "First, we access the Guoker Biology Research
Protocol Tribe. Weve already submitted and had our report approved that
discusses the importance of studying Earthlings. Look, by building this
‘Earth People Research Institute’, we can gain a significant amount of
wealth credits."</p>
<p>"Now, I’m logged into the Guoker House Manufacturing Protocol Tribe,"
said Suldair. "We give them certain wealth credits, and they help us
build. Right now, they need the structural blueprints from us, which can
take a long time to prepare."</p>
<p>"There are plenty of free, ready-made blueprints on the GIW," Willie
interjected. "I’ll search for them."</p>
<p>Shortly, Willie announced she had found the blueprints.</p>
<p>"How long will the Guoker House Manufacturing Protocol Tribe take to
build this house?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Just a moment, literally a few seconds by Earth standards," Norton
replied. "On Guoker Planet, building houses and manufacturing products
are instantaneous. The actual construction doesn’t take long; it’s the
design that takes time."</p>
<p>"Why so fast?" I wondered.</p>
<p>Norton clarified, "The Guoker House Manufacturing Protocol Tribe uses
the GlW to construct buildings. The GMW can perform high-speed remote
cutting, moving, cold welding, and assembly, all under automated
computer control. Even the tribe members don’t go to the site; they
operate remotely via the GIW."</p>
<p>A square on Willie’s virtual computer quickly expanded outwards, and
with her hands mimicking the expansion, she exclaimed, "The house is
built!"</p>
<p>We quickly visited the newly constructed house via GMW. It was
impressive, substantial, and decidedly real, not virtual.</p>
<p>Touching the smooth walls, Norton remarked, "These are cut from
mountain rock by the GMW, not synthetically produced, preserving the
natural patterns of the stone. I find these patterns stunningly
beautiful."</p>
<p>"By building this house, you can earn a lot of money, right?" I asked
them.</p>
<p>"Yes, our wealth credits have increased considerably," Suldair
confirmed. "And as this building serves its purpose, we’ll continue to
earn more."</p>
<p>Norton added, "If the building becomes obsolete, it might be
demolished, and we would stop receiving future credits. Under certain
circumstances on Guoker Planet, buildings harmful to people or the
environment might even lead to a deduction of the builder’s wealth
credits."</p>
<p>Seeing their ease at constructing the building, I was still confused,
"It seems quite easy to make money this way. Why do you say it’s
difficult?"</p>
<p>"The main issue is gaining approval for your proposals and ensuring
they are responded to," explained Norton. "Also, you need to join a
protocol tribe and rely on an organization, as its hard for individuals
to earn money on their own."</p>
<p>Willie added, "Individuals can still provide services, engage in
scientific research, or create cultural and artistic works to earn
money. Alternatively, you can convert your sexual activities with a
partner into digital data and sell it on the GIW."</p>
<p>I asked, "If Guokers dont earn money, how do they manage?"</p>
<p>Willie replied, "Ah, thats actually not a concern. We regularly
receive wealth credits, ensuring our basic needs are met. However, if
you desire a more vibrant life, filled with happiness, novel
experiences, and exciting games, then you need to strive for additional
wealth credits. In Guoker society, many essentials like nutrition
supplements, travel, housing, most games and pets, medical treatments,
health maintenance, and even body modifications are provided free of
charge."</p>
<p>Curious, I questioned, "If I simply wait for my regular wealth
credits and save them, could I eventually become very wealthy?"</p>
<p>Suldair responded, "Thats a rather passive approach. On Guoker
Planet, such behavior might label you as lazy, Brother Qian. If you
neither earn nor spend wealth credits over a long period, you might lose
some of them. Theres an algorithm that easily detects such behavior, and
our society doesnt really welcome laziness. On our Planet, wealth
equates to power. Those who accumulate wealth credits have the ability
to influence others actions, similar to holding power. Simply put, being
wealthy means youre a leader and possess significant influence. Thus,
money is even more crucial on Guoker Planet than on Earth."</p>
<p>Norton added, "Many of our goods are free, and as youve seen, we own
very few possessions. Unlike Earth, where money is made through
production, that model doesnt apply here. Individuals must affiliate
with organizations to make significant money, as its hard for them to
compete against powerful groups. These strong organizations provide
high-quality goods and services for free, making competition nearly
impossible. Only customized products or services can be offered by
individuals. Particularly, organizations that control the GMW, GIW, and
advanced algorithms can afford to provide high-quality, free products,
information, and services on a large scale, which leaves little room for
individuals to compete and diminishes their opportunities to earn
money."</p>
<p>Resigned, I noted, "So, it seems I wont be able to take any Guoker
currency back to Earth to show off."</p>
<p>"Exactly," Suldair confirmed, "as per Guoker regulations, you cant
take anything back with you."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-28---the-leader-of-guoker-planet">Chapter 28 - The
Leader of Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>Once, Norton and I visited a Guoker biologist named Ivanson, who
shared Nortons physique. Ivanson appeared mature, with sharp eyes and an
intelligent demeanor. He was not only Nortons colleague but also more
renowned and essentially their leader.</p>
<p>Upon meeting me, Ivanson extended a warm greeting: "Welcome, Brother
Qian, from Earth. We, including Norton, Willie, and Suldair, are all
members of the Studying Earth People Tribe on the GIW. We often discuss
Earthlings and look forward to exchanging ideas with you."</p>
<p>Curious, I asked, "How many countries exist on Guoker Planet?"</p>
<p>"There is only one country; the entire planet is unified under a
single nation," Ivanson responded.</p>
<p>"And who is the supreme leader here on Guoker Planet?"</p>
<p>"We dont have a supreme leader," he replied.</p>
<p>"You don’t have a supreme leader? That’s hard to imagine. Even the
underworld on Earth has its bosses. When I first stepped onto Guoker, I
half-expected some high official might welcome me. No wonder there was
none."</p>
<p>Ivanson clarified, "Strictly speaking, our supreme leader is virtual,
residing on the Global Information Web as the Union of GIW Protocol
Algorithms. I lead the Guoker Biology Research Tribe, so my authority is
specifically in biological research. Our leadership is essentially an
agreed-upon set of algorithms on the GIW, continuously evolving and
adapting. These are not individuals but a form of artificial
intelligence developed collaboratively by many people across different
locations and times. In contrast, Earths leaders are actual individuals,
correct?"</p>
<p>I explained, "Earth’s leadership structure is pyramid-shaped. Many
countries are led by a president or chairman. Below them are governors,
followed by county heads, then mayors or village heads, down to the
ordinary citizens."</p>
<p>Norton added, "Our entire planet is one country, and actually, Guoker
is part of a planetary system that includes several dozen colonized
planets, all governed by Guoker. Essentially, the Guoker system itself
is a nation, without other countries within this system. Our highest
authority is the GIW Algorithm Protocol Union, followed by tribe leaders
on the GIW, and then the ordinary citizens."</p>
<p>Suldair chimed in, "I believe the real power lies with those
controlling the GMW. Think about it: everything we do depends on GMW,
which essentially controls the entirety of Guoker from behind the
scenes."</p>
<p>Willie offered a different perspective, "In my view, its the Pricing
Algorithm Tribe Union that holds more power. They determine how much
wealth credits we earn for our actions, which, I believe, makes them
more influential than those controlling the GMW."</p>
<p>Norton concluded, "Determining fair compensation for actions taken by
the myriad of individuals on our planet, given the complexity and scale,
is not something one person can manage. Thats why the Information
Network Algorithm Union was created as the first of its kind,
establishing fair prices through cooperation and compromise. The Total
Algorithm Union that oversees all algorithm unions on the GIW
effectively serves as the supreme leadership of Guoker Planet."</p>
<p>Suldair said: "Once I suspected that the Pricing Algorithm Union had
miscalculated my wealth credits. I warned them, and threatened to report
them to the GIW Supervision Union if they ignored me. They promptly
apologized and adjusted my wealth credits. They didn’t seem as powerful
as I had thought."</p>
<p>He continued, pondering, "Perhaps those tribe unions that directly
issue wealth credits are even more influential."</p>
<p>I expressed my confusion: "So it seems unclear who the supreme leader
on Guoker Planet really is. Your leaders are merely algorithms within
computers and networks; they arent real people. How can you be content
being governed by these virtual leaders? Your planet is so advanced; why
would you accept a virtual leader?"</p>
<p>Ivanson explained, "The evolution of our virtual leaders was gradual,
not decided in a single meeting. As the GIW and GMW developed, it became
nearly impossible for individuals to accumulate wealth independently;
they relied heavily on these systems. The GIW and GMW solve almost all
our daily and economic problems, making the emergence of virtual leaders
an inevitable outcome."</p>
<p>Ivanson then activated a virtual display, which illustrated numerous
war scenes that seemed to hail from an era of cold weapons.</p>
<p>"Reflecting on our history, Guoker Planet once had many countries,
much like Earth, and they often waged wars over resources and material
wealth," Ivanson narrated. "Once the GIW and GMW were established,
resources and material wealth became insignificant, practically free.
With no need to fight over resources and with currency fully digitized,
nations lost their power to issue money and thus their influence."</p>
<p>He added, "The GMW enables instantaneous global travel, diminishing
the need for national borders that only hinder mobility and societal
development. With the GMW also capable of preventing crimes anytime and
anywhere, the traditional roles of nations—defending against invasions,
fighting crime, and maintaining order—became obsolete. Eventually,
nations on Guoker Planet faded away. As nations disappeared, so did
national leaders, replaced gradually by the GIW Algorithm Protocol
Union, which had emerged even before the dissolution of nations."</p>
<p>Curious, I ventured, "I might have a naive question, but dont
laugh—how difficult is it for a Guoker to become a leader, or a tribe
leader, as you call it?"</p>
<p>"Its quite challenging," Ivanson replied. "Firstly, you must choose a
tribe that aligns with your expertise. For instance, if youre skilled in
biology, you might join the Guoker Biology Research Tribe. Youd
regularly share your insights on the GIW, actively participate in
various affairs, and after a long period, if your contributions
significantly surpass those of the current leader—as measured by precise
algorithms—and with the tribes consent, you might replace them. However,
leaders are not frequently replaced, and given our immortality, aspiring
to be a leader requires immense patience."</p>
<p>Intrigued, I asked, "Could someone expedite their leadership by
purchasing it, assuming they had sufficient wealth to sway tribe
members?"</p>
<p>Suldair burst into laughter: "Ha-ha! Thats a very Earthly
approach—always excelling in bribery!"</p>
<p>Norton chimed in, "Buying leadership on Guoker Planet is highly
improbable. Our basic needs are free, so theres minimal demand for
money. Additionally, the GIW Supervision Union would quickly detect and
thwart any attempts at bribery, making it nearly impossible to buy a
leadership position."</p>
<p>"Ivanson, with the advent of the Internet on Earth, similar to our
GIW, if Earthlings can decipher the essence of the field, you can
establish a GMW. With GMW, Earthlings could instantly appear anywhere in
the world. Eventually, nations will fade, and the Earth will unite as a
single country," Ivanson explained. "Your earthly leaders will gradually
be replaced by virtual leaders on the Internet. This is a trend in the
evolution of universal civilizations—no advanced civilization can avoid
this. The governance by virtual leaders on the Internet is inevitable
for Earthlings; it just depends on how quickly you decipher the essence
of the field."</p>
<p>"So, who is the most powerful on your planet?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The virtual leaders on the GIW are essentially artificially created
intelligences. They are algorithms that control and dominate our planet.
The real power lies with mathematicians—the creators and holders of
these algorithms. They undeniably control our planet," Ivanson
stated.</p>
<p>"What about physicists? Isnt physics important?" I queried.</p>
<p>"Physics is crucial as it forms the foundation of all sciences.
However, at a certain point, physics naturally concludes its
development. Once a civilization recognizes that the universe is
composed of matter and the space surrounding it, with no third entity
existing alongside, any further understanding becomes merely an
observer’s description of the motion of matter in space or the space
around matter. That marks the end of physics; it expands no further than
this plane, occasionally requiring minor corrections. But mathematics
has no endpoint. In some respects, physics is merely a branch of
mathematics, specifically one that describes motion," Ivanson
responded.</p>
<p>"Mathematicians can be quite daunting. They form exclusive circles
and control key resources. If you want to join their circle, you must
decipher the entry codes theyve established—these are various
algorithms. Some of these algorithms are artificially designed by them,
while others are naturally occurring but discovered by humans. Cracking
these algorithms is incredibly challenging, and many geniuses struggle
to gain access."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-29---virtual-tours">Chapter 29 - Virtual Tours</h2>
<p>Once at Willies place, I asked her, "Why do I get the feeling that
you Guoker people share a trait of being laid-back and unhurried in
everything you do?"</p>
<p>"Guoker life is primarily about enjoyment," Willie replied, turning
on the bed. "Ordinary people arent allowed to work, be it physical or
mental, because they would only complicate things. We rely entirely on
the GMW and GIW, both of which are virtual networks operated by
artificial intelligence that has evolved over thousands of years and is
far superior to any human capability. Only those with special skills are
permitted to work, and even then, work is a minority activity and takes
up only a fraction of the time compared to leisure. If your Earths
technology were advanced enough, youd live similarly."</p>
<p>"For most ordinary Guokers like myself, since the GMW automatically
provides our bodies with energy and nutrition under computer control, we
dont need to worry about food and drink like Earthlings do. Our clothes
are virtual, created remotely by the GIW as holographic images that
integrate with our bodies—some even grow directly from our bodies. Thus,
we dont have to think about clothing like you do.</p>
<p>"We have no parents, no siblings, and we dont worry about illness or
death. While Earthlings chase wealth and power, we pursue sensations and
experiences. Our lives are filled with play; playing is everything to
us, as it allows us to gain more experiences."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see. What do you usually play? Where do you go to play? What
do you play with?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, there are many ways to play. Ive taken you to a few places; we
often go on virtual tours..." Willie pondered, then suddenly leapt out
of bed and said, "Brother Qian, lets go on a virtual tour now."</p>
<p>"Are we leaving now?" I stood up and walked toward the door.</p>
<p>"No need to go anywhere; we can take a virtual tour right here,"
Willie said, pulling my arms and nestling her head against my chest.
"Ill start it now."</p>
<p>Willie waved her hand through the air, and a white mist arose,
quickly transforming into a large, three-dimensional hologram. This was
created remotely by their GMW and GIW.</p>
<p>The hologram displayed towering trees amid an expansive grassland.
Guoker script floated overhead, and the GIW customer service translated
it as "Savage Plains."</p>
<p>"Well soon gear up, choose mounts and weapons, and maybe even
servants and pets—though I think well skip the pets. Were going back to
the savage era, understand?" Willie explained.</p>
<p>"Um, I understand," I replied, though I was rather bewildered.</p>
<p>"Alright, our virtual tour officially begins now," Willie announced,
waving her hand through the air again. Suddenly, the scenery around us
shifted dramatically, and Willie and I were integrated into the virtual
image.</p>
<p>We stood on the savage plains, appearing as a primitive couple
adorned only with leaves and flower garlands. Later, we reached an area
teeming with animals where we chose mounts resembling a cross between
lions and horses. Elsewhere, Willie and I equipped ourselves with bows
and curved swords.</p>
<p>Initially reluctant about pets, Willie changed her mind. We didnt
take any servants; instead, we each chose a bird resembling a parrot,
which flew ahead, accompanying us on our journey.</p>
<p>As we walked, we witnessed three people chasing another. Willie
explained that they were bandits pursuing a merchant with intent to kill
him. "We should help the merchant and fight the bandits," I suggested.
However, Willie wanted us to hide. I questioned, "Wouldnt it be painful
to lose the fight and be killed?"</p>
<p>"Not really," Willie replied. "It would simply mean the end of this
virtual tour."</p>
<p>"Then why dont we intervene? The poor merchant is about to be
killed."</p>
<p>"Theres no why. Listen to me," Willie snapped suddenly, becoming
authoritarian. "You only attack when I say so."</p>
<p>Later, we encountered an army. This time, Willie commanded us to
attack. I hesitated, but she, brandishing her machete, had already
charged forward. We fought valiantly, yet were struck by many arrows,
each hit painfully noticeable. Just as we seemed on the verge of
capture, we had no choice but to roll down a cliff. At the bottom, I
criticized Willie’s reckless commands, and she retorted that I was
cowardly and foolish. Our argument escalated, and Willie, declaring she
was done playing, waved her hand, changing our surroundings back to her
home.</p>
<p>Willie spoke coquettishly, "Brother Qian, I called you foolish, but
youre not upset, right? Shall we continue the virtual tour?"</p>
<p>"Sure, Im not upset. This virtual tour is incredibly realistic and
fun. Id like to keep going."</p>
<p>"Alright, lets continue," Willie said, her flirtatious demeanor
shifting abruptly. "But this time, we’ll travel separately. I don’t want
to travel with you anymore."</p>
<p>She swiped her hand in the air, and a fog reappeared, gradually
forming a three-dimensional hologram. We re-entered the virtual tour
scene.</p>
<p>This time, I had the freedom to choose. I opted for a Pink Peach
Blossom Garden. Why would Willie choose the violent Wild Lands?</p>
<p>The Pink Peach Blossom Garden seemed themed around love, perhaps even
with sexual elements. As expected, the scene was filled with soft pink
scarves floating from the sky, flanked by rows of peach trees. Enveloped
in giant peach blossoms, tender female forms made enticing gestures. A
voiceover said, "Resist temptation to successfully navigate
through."</p>
<p>As I walked, the peach blossoms drew closer, allowing me to touch the
bodies within, which felt incredibly smooth and emitted a heady,
youthful fragrance, overwhelmingly seductive.</p>
<p>Why resist? Why leave this garden? Approaching the end, the peach
blossoms nearly enveloped me, with many women reaching out their pink
hands, caressing me. I longed to embrace one of them, willing to fulfill
her desires. But suddenly, a heart-shaped balloon obstructed my embrace,
flashing Guoker script that the Kevin translated: "Your beloved woman is
calling you!"</p>
<p>My beloved woman? Willie? Was this another disruption? Indeed, it
turned out to be Willie.</p>
<p>"You said you didnt want to travel with me anymore, didnt you?" I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Ah, but Ive changed my mind. Now, I want you as my mount, to ride
everywhere—in the wilds, youll be my steed; in the sea, my fish; in your
Earths car era, my sofa cushion; and in our flying saucer, the seat,"
she declared.</p>
<p>"I am a human, how can you just turn me into these bizarre things?" I
protested.</p>
<p>Willie confidently assured, "I can make it so youll enjoy being my
mount." With a gesture, she transformed me into a creature part lion,
part horse.</p>
<p>Willie sat on me, and I immediately felt her bare skin against mine.
So, this was why she was confident Id enjoy her riding. Her smooth skin
and the contours of her body were undeniably stimulating. Together, we
embarked on another virtual tour. Our adventures took us to primitive
tribes, the depths of the ocean, and deep inside volcanoes with their
fierce fires and surging red lava, among other extraordinary places.
Later, our flying saucer journeyed to a warlike planet where we were
shot down and captured. The locals dissected us, a process so vivid I
could hear the slicing of our skin. With the help of a few alien allies,
we managed to escape and start anew. However, our journey was repeatedly
marred by Willies reckless decisions, ending in a heated argument.</p>
<p>Still not satisfied, Willie invited Suldair and Norton to join us at
a dedicated virtual tour venue. We traveled there through the GMW. The
venue was impressively tall and stylish, notable for its lack of doors,
with many circles on the ground by the walls. People would step into a
circle, a point of light would begin to slowly rotate around it, and
Guoker text and images would appear on the walls. Norton pressed
something on the wall, and we all entered.</p>
<p>Inside, the space was vast, divided into many small sections just big
enough for one person. Upon entering, individuals would float as if in
zero gravity.</p>
<p>I learned that Guoker virtual tours involve transmitting various
environmental signals into the human brain using a technology that
intercepts frequencies during artificial field scans. This technology
suspends the body in midair and adjusts its posture to enhance the
realism of the experience. This was far more advanced than the simple
bed setup at Willies home.</p>
<p>The professional venue offered a broader array of choices and more
lifelike scenarios than we could experience at Willies. It was so
convincing that it was hard to distinguish from reality, although I
continually reminded myself that it was just a virtual tour. However, in
the games, certain signals were modified; for example, the pain from
weapons was mild, whereas the sensations during virtual sexual
encounters were indistinguishable from real life.</p>
<p>I explored several scenarios including "Space Travel," "Fighting
Barbarians," and "I am the King." The programs involving sexual content
were particularly thrilling and alluring.</p>
<p>"Space Travel" simulated a spaceship voyage, providing aerial views
of various celestial bodies, with detailed voiceovers, especially about
planets inhabited by aliens, describing them as having highly advanced
civilizations.</p>
<p>In "Fighting Barbarians," I sought out content related to Earth. A
voiceover explained that I didnt need to speak, only think about what I
desired. Indeed, I found a version involving Earth, featuring Americans,
Europeans, Japanese, and Chinese, indicating these nations intrigued the
Guokers. The Japanese were depicted as prone to indiscriminately killing
both foreigners and their own people. The Chinese were shown typically
being grabbed by the hair and decapitated. Americans were portrayed as
muscular with large upper bodies, thin waists, and legs like steel
forks. Europeans were characterized as philosophical types, often
depicted with smoking pipes.</p>
<p>The Earth version of "I am the King" had me playing a king who led
his people against enemies, ferreted out traitors, managed the military,
governed the nation, and dealt with the frustrations of multiple
wives.</p>
<p>I was particularly drawn to the virtual erotica games. "My Insect
Girlfriend" featured a colossal insect with a hybrid body of a woman and
an insect. Her body was segmented, each section boasting a pair of
breasts, and she could move by crawling or wriggling on the ground. She
could also emit brightly colored, sticky liquids in green, pink, or
other hues from her mouth and lower body. Her plump, wriggling form was
designed to be highly enticing to men. This insect woman was capable of
setting numerous traps to lure you in.</p>
<p>In "Spider Woman," the character was devilishly slim and agile, able
to spin webs that could ensnare you. Her silken threads could even
penetrate your body to control and capture you. However, you had access
to various tools to thwart her schemes.</p>
<p>"Snake Woman" was cunning and venomous, capable of camouflaging
herself as a plant to ambush her prey. Once struck by her venom, you
would temporarily lose the ability to move, as she coiled around you and
invaded your body, making it nearly impossible to remove her.</p>
<p>The Earth version included a scenario with a colossal woman who would
tightly bind you with strips of cloth, treating you like a child and
overfeeding you with breast milk while carrying you around, thereby
depriving you of your freedom.</p>
<p>In "Ocean World," you encountered a myriad of bizarre creatures, most
of which were hybrids of women and various marine animals. These
creatures combined the physical features of women with those of large
fish, sharks, octopuses, and more. Some were immense seashells with
women parasitizing inside. Men would feel as if they were truly swimming
in the ocean, engaging in a battle of wits and bravery with these
beautiful, dangerous creatures.</p>
<p>On land, the most common hybrids included snakes, worms, and women,
as well as hybrids resembling lions, frogs, fleas, birds, and more. Many
of these were parasitic species that lay in wait in forests, underbrush,
oceans, caves, and even the skies or clouds, setting elaborate traps to
capture men or invade their bodies, making men their prey or hosts. Men,
armed with various magical tools, had to outsmart these women, avoid
being captured, or escape from being enveloped or injected with
venom.</p>
<p>Guoker’s erotic virtual games catered to male audiences with their
diverse array of bizarre, animal-woman hybrids. These creatures used
tentacles, appendages, venom, and various secretions as weapons to
capture men. The games were designed with various traps and challenges
that men had to overcome using their wits and magical tools. Women
players, on the other hand, typically encountered male-animal
hybrids.</p>
<p>After a lengthy session at the virtual tour club, I was exhausted and
barely remember how I returned to Willies place, where the line between
reality and virtual scenes often blurred.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-30---a-remote-sex-experience">Chapter 30 - A Remote Sex
Experience</h2>
<p>One day, I woke from sleep to find Willie gone. I sat up in bed,
dazed, when suddenly music played and a white fog arose beside me. A
holographic image appeared; it was Willie, clad in an odd, metallic
outfit. She said, “Brother Qian, I’ve left Guoker Planet with Suldair
and Norton. We’re on a nearby planet now and can’t return yet. Don’t
leave your place, it could be dangerous. If you get bored, you can use
this virtual computer. Just point where you want to look on the
holographic image. Oh, Im starting to miss you! I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>I spent some time on the virtual computer, and Willie’s home robot
brought me food. Curious about what the trembling robot was made of, I
reached out and grabbed it as it neared. It dodged swiftly, but I
managed to catch it. As I probed its body, each molecule in my palm
tingled with a slight electric shock, revealing that the robot too was a
hologram. Eventually, it transformed into a tiny stream of red metallic
liquid and slithered back into a box.</p>
<p>Realizing Guoker Planet was a virtual realm, I attempted to explore
virtual travel. Unfamiliar with the computer controls, I randomly
clicked around, only seeing bizarre images and hearing indecipherable
alien conversations. At night, I stopped using the computer, and the 3D
holograms vanished. Lying in bed, I daydreamed about the sensual scenes
from virtual sex games, but, alone, I didn’t know how to start them. My
thoughts turned to Willie and her delicate, alluring figure.</p>
<p>Suddenly, music played again, and a 3D hologram reappeared beside me.
Willie was in a metallic room, waving her hands. “Brother Qian, I’m now
living in a room aboard a flying saucer. This planet is desolate with no
proper dwellings. I miss you—please hold me. Turn around, see that red
square frame below the wall behind you? There’s a red dot in the middle.
Touch it, just like that.”</p>
<p>I found the red square frame and pressed the red dot. Instantly, a
box extended, and I saw a container filled with an ultra-smooth, milky
white gelatinous substance. It suddenly sprang to life, flowed onto the
floor, and rapidly shaped into a human form identical to Willie.
Whatever actions Willie performed or words she spoke in the virtual
display, the gel-formed fake Willie mirrored exactly.</p>
<p>“Ah, Willie, you’ve come back?”</p>
<p>“No,” both the fake Willie and the real Willie in the hologram said
simultaneously.</p>
<p>“I’m currently on the flying saucer. I’m transmitting my movement
signals to the Guoker GIW, which then relays them to the red box at my
home. When activated by these signals, the white substance in the box
morphs into a human body—a replica of me.</p>
<p>“This fake Willie responds to my movement signals, mirroring my
actions. Whether you’re engaging in a conversation or more intimate
activities with her, it’s indistinguishable from being with the real me.
Do you understand now? Holding this fake Willie feels exactly the same
as holding the real me.”</p>
<p>I embraced the synthetic version of Willie, and it felt
indistinguishably similar to holding the real Willie. Curiously, I even
sniffed her chest and groin areas, noting that the scent was
surprisingly more intense than usual.</p>
<p>On the virtual screen, I saw Willie pull out a red box. A white gel
inside it swiftly took human form—my own likeness. Willie tightly hugged
this replica, and the artificial Willie mirrored her actions with
me.</p>
<p>As we passionately made love on the bed, the synthetic Willie later
positioned herself on top and remarked, "On Guoker Planet, we often
prefer these remote intimate encounters over the physical ones."</p>
<p>Puzzled, I asked, "Why is that?"</p>
<p>"Its because these avatars can change forms at will." As she spoke,
her bodys color transitioned from a delicate pink to gray, then to a
glossy black, followed by red, yellow, green, blue, cyan, purple, and
back to pink again.</p>
<p>Watching the synthetic Willie, I noticed her breasts began to
elongate dramatically, stretching over a meter long like arms, caressing
me as if they were real. Then, she kissed me, her tongue extending
deeper and deeper, from my mouth down to my stomach, the sensation of
her touch vivid and intense.</p>
<p>"Im going to release a human-like scent," said the synthetic Willie.
Soon after, I was enveloped by a potent, alluring fragrance reminiscent
of a young woman.</p>
<p>Her body alternated between smaller and larger forms. Throughout our
lovemaking, her groin secreted copious amounts of a lubricating fluid
that clung to her body without spilling.</p>
<p>Exhausted, I soon fell asleep. Upon waking, I found the synthetic
Willie next to me, now motionless and expressionless.</p>
<p>I checked the virtual computer; Willie seemed busy elsewhere, likely
having stowed the dummy and the red box. Unsure of how to deactivate the
synthetic Willie, I lay down beside her again.</p>
<p>Upon my next awakening, the synthetic Willie was gone, the virtual
computer shut off, and the red box had returned to its original spot.
Whether it was remotely controlled by Willie or it shut down
automatically, I wasnt sure. But I knew the remote intimacy session had
ended, and it was time to sleep again.</p>
<p>Willie, Suldair, and Norton soon arrived, waking me. "Brother Qian,
how did you find the remote intimacy?" Willie asked as she embraced
me.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, it was quite exhausting," I replied.</p>
<p>"You took it very seriously," Willie commented. "Did you mess up my
equipment?"</p>
<p>"No, how could I?" I responded.</p>
<p>"Lets have a look," Willie said, pressing the red dot on the box. The
box extended out, revealing a differently colored, yellow-tinged spot on
the white gel. "Whats this? You definitely made a mess."</p>
<p>"This is Brother Qians semen. Earth men ejaculate during sex, unlike
our men," Norton explained. "I need this for my experiment." After a
brief press on his ear, the stain in the red box swiftly disappeared,
presumably cleaned by GMW.</p>
<p>"Earth men are dirty. From now on, Ill only engage in remote intimacy
with you to stay clean," Willie remarked to me.</p>
<p>Laughing, Suldair added, "Ho-ho-ho, Willie, Guoker men are cleaner,
arent we? Your bodys already been tainted by Brother Qian. Should we
develop a program for GMW to clean up the mess left by Earth men?"</p>
<p>Reflecting momentarily, Willie replied, "Ive actually grown fond of
the filth from Brother Qians groin. Tonight, Ill endeavor to collect
more of that white sticky substance Ive previously seen on him."</p>
<p>Suldair asked Willie, "Did you record this session of remote
intimacy? If you did, you could upload it to the GIW and attract many
admirers. You, Willie, could instantly become a sex symbol on Guoker
Planet. Imagine tens of thousands of Guoker men setting their sex robots
to emulate you, embracing you virtually every day. Ho-ho-ho..."</p>
<p>Willie replied, "But Im nothing special like Brother Qian. Hes tall,
strong, and unique—qualities that captivate Guoker women. How could I
possibly become a sex star?"</p>
<p>"So, did you record it or not?" Suldair pressed.</p>
<p>"No, I didnt. But Im sure Norton did. After all, wasn’t his purpose
in bringing him from Earth to capture all sorts of data?" Willie
responded.</p>
<p>Indeed, Norton had not only recorded the session but also our
cognitive experiences. The Guoker people enjoy converting all personal
information—including physiological and kinesthetic data, as well as
sexual interactions—into digitized formats, which they refer to as sex
data.</p>
<p>Some individuals even commercialize their sex data on the GIW,
similar to Earthlings selling music CDs. This practice constitutes a
significant business and is a vital income source for the average
Guoker.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are plenty of free sex data available on the GIW,
uploaded just for fun. For instance, a Guoker woman can purchase a man’s
sex data, use it to configure her home gel-based dummy to resemble him,
and then engage in physical intimacy with this synthetic partner. To
her, the experience is indistinguishably real. They purchase these sex
data for personal use, somewhat akin to Earthlings watching videos—yet
with the interactive capability that their technology affords.</p>
<p>Remote intimacy, facilitated through synchronized gel dummies and
transmitted signals, parallels watching a live broadcast on Earth. The
kind of remote sex Willie and I engaged in falls into this category. A
notable benefit of this method is the elimination of potential violence;
participants can terminate the session if it turns coercive. However,
for those inexperienced in setting the correct intensity levels, a
mistake might result in an overpowering experience: an excessively
energetic partner could exhibit formidable strength and stamina,
overwhelming the other party with rapid and vigorous actions, leading to
discomfort and fear.</p>
<p>Some Guoker individuals have become incredibly successful by selling
their sex data, with sales reaching hundreds of millions. Theyve risen
to the status of sex stars. Later, I had the opportunity to sample
various types of this data, including those from men, women,
gender-neutral individuals, hybrid creatures, and even purely
animalistic forms. Whether desiring intimacy with a woman or a
fantastical beast, one simply needs to purchase the corresponding sex
data.</p>
<p>Among the sex data Ive experienced, there are some that are
exceptionally amazing, truly indescribable with words. Just a few
minutes with them could leave a lasting impression, delighting you to
your very core. The sight of their naked bodies and their enticing
voices alone could make your heart flutter. When I shared this with
Norton and his friends, I asked, "So, do these top-tier sex data cost a
fortune?"</p>
<p>Their response was enlightening. "The most exquisite sex data arent
provided by real people; theyre generated by sophisticated AI algorithms
with powerful computing capabilities," they explained. "On Earth,
anything synthetic is typically seen as inferior, and natural products
are preferred. Here on our planet its the exact opposite. In my opinion,
the natural sex data pales in comparison to the AI-generated ones—theyre
simply not on the same level."</p>
<p>They continued, "For us Guoker people, pursuing sex data is not just
a trivial pastime; its an integral part of life, akin to eating or
finding a mate on Earth. While Earthlings often choose partners based on
physical attractiveness, we seek novelty, personality, and uniqueness in
our sex data. Quality isnt our main concern. Thats why we frequently
abduct beings from other planets to produce sex data. These data might
not always be of high quality, but their exotic nature keeps them
selling well. If the data combine great quality, a compelling user
experience, and a touch of the bizarre, they can become wildly popular
and remain in demand for much longer. Providers of such sex data can
accumulate immense wealth."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-31---the-3d-virtual-partner-on-guoker-planet">Chapter 31
- The 3D Virtual Partner on Guoker Planet</h2>
<p>On Earth, we are familiar with boys having girlfriends and girls
having boyfriends as partners. When a boy finds a girl online just for
chatting, that is considered a virtual partner.</p>
<p>Virtual partners are widely popular on Guoker Planet, but their
virtual partners are very different from ours on Earth. This difference
is due to their highly advanced technology. The development of Guoker
Planet’s virtual partners went through five stages, each achieved
through technological advancements.</p>
<p>In the first stage, people used physical information processing
devices such as computers and cell phones, along with the GIW and social
applications, to communicate and interact. We on Earth are already
capable of this, though our software and hardware still need
improvement.</p>
<p>In the second stage, people communicated and interacted through
projection tools. Later, their computers and cell phones could project
high-quality 3D holograms. To achieve satisfactory effects, they
installed several 3D projectors in different corners of a room. Portable
information processors, combined with multiple fixed projectors, created
3D holograms in the room. This allowed people to communicate and
interact via the GIW as if they were standing next to each other. On
Earth, we have smartphones capable of projecting holograms, but their
quality is poor and the 3D effect is not very realistic. Some VR
products require users to wear specially designed goggles, which is a
significant drawback.</p>
<p>In the third stage, people used portable imaging devices to
communicate and interact. By this stage, their information processing
devices were small enough to be invisible, only projecting 3D virtual
images. A boy might see a pretty girl appear before him, but she is
actually a 3D hologram created by a tiny device. At this stage, virtual
partners looked almost like real people and could move freely, even
accompanying their owners outside. However, if the projection beam was
obstructed, the hologram would disappear.</p>
<p>In the fourth stage, people interacted through purely virtual images.
With the advent of artificial field scanning technology, their virtual
technology advanced rapidly. They eliminated hardware entirely.
Artificial field scanners, installed in orbit like satellites, could
remotely move objects and create 3D holograms and sound from a great
distance. Instead of emitting beams to create holograms, these scanners
collected light from the target area to generate 3D images and sound by
vibrating the air. Since artificial field scanning could penetrate solid
objects without affecting them, it could create movable 3D images and
sound anywhere in the world, unhindered by any obstacles. With this
technology, people could interact with virtual partners almost as if
they were real, and these virtual partners could even exert force on
objects. For example, if a girl asked a virtual boyfriend to move a
table, the hologram itself couldnt move the table, but the artificial
field device could remotely move the table, making it seem like the
virtual boyfriend was doing it.</p>
<p>Phase five: communicating and interacting through information gel. As
things continue to develop, this is how their virtual partners look in
the fifth stage: A boy walks into a room and presses a switch.
Instantly, a 3D hologram of a distant pretty girl appears in a strange
environment. The hologram moves to a box, which automatically opens to
reveal some information gel material inside. When the hologram enters
the box, the information gel becomes active and quickly forms an exact
replica of the girl. The gel itself isnt self-propelled; its movement is
remotely powered by the GMW. This is crucial because the gel consists of
tiny particles that would be difficult and unreliable to equip with
individual power sources. The girl formed by the gel not only looks
identical to the hologram but also mimics the real girls actions
precisely, being controlled remotely by her. To human senses, there is
no difference between the gel girl and the real girl. This way, when the
boy interacts with the gel girl, it is as if he is interacting with a
real person. They can even engage in sex, which feels identical to real
sex.</p>
<p>Willie explained that some of them lack sex organs, so they use tools
formed from the information gel to engage in sexual activity.
Light-based virtual people can also use this method to have sex with
real people or with each other. Additionally, it is common for them to
input sexual signals directly into the brain to experience virtual
sex.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-32---sex-clubs">Chapter 32 - Sex Clubs</h2>
<p>Once, Willie invited me to visit a sex club on Guoker Planet, and I
gladly accepted.</p>
<p>Willie said that Guoker Planet has many free public sex clubs that
cater to the special needs of its inhabitants. However, some private sex
clubs require the payment of wealth credits.</p>
<p>Willie and I arrived at a large public sex club via the GMW. The club
was enormous, seemingly endless, with huge virtual texts floating above
it.</p>
<p>There was no door; the walls looked like solid structures, painted
with vertical grids that seemed to be virtual in the middle, with many
bits and pieces swirling around and Guoker texts scrolling upwards. I
saw many Guoker couples passing through the grids, as well as many
single men and women.</p>
<p>"How can single people enter? How do they find partners?" I
asked.</p>
<p>Willie replied, "You can arrange to meet a partner through the GIW.
Even if you cant find a partner, you can engage with virtual people
inside. The sex club has many devices and settings that you dont have at
home, providing a unique experience."</p>
<p>I held Willies hand as we approached the club wall. Hesitating, I
stopped, but Willie quickly moved in front of me, pulling me into the
club.</p>
<p>Inside was a narrow passage blocked by a large virtual screen. To the
side was a row of human figures with their faces replaced by large
holes. I saw people sticking their heads into the holes, so I did the
same. Inside, I saw Guoker couples engaging in sex. This wasnt
surprising, as the sex club was meant for this. The moaning of the women
was incredibly seductive, suggesting that the sex club had more to
offer. Although Willie quickly pulled me away, the brief moment of
hearing those moans left a strong impression on me that I could never
forget. Later, I learned that most of these sounds were generated by
powerful AI algorithms, not by real people. Even when real people were
involved, the GIW would enhance the sounds. Kevin had a voice enhanced
in a similar way.</p>
<p>Willie pointed to a line of text and said, "We need to choose an
activity here. What do you think about this one?"</p>
<p>I saw an image of a naked couple embracing on a swing. "Thats too
simple and boring."</p>
<p>"I agree," Willie said, pointing to another option. "How about this
one?"</p>
<p>I saw an image of a horse-like animal with a compartment on its back.
A naked man lay in the compartment, while a woman rode on top of him,
urging the horse to run.</p>
<p>I wasnt very interested and wanted to see the next option, but Willie
was very enthusiastic about this one and pressed the confirmation button
without waiting for my agreement.</p>
<p>We were instantly transported to a desolate wilderness, with no one
around except Willie, who was standing naked, holding the reins of a
horse-like creature.</p>
<p>"Where are we? What is this place?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Were far from the main sex club, but still within its territory. You
can only reach this place through the sex club, which acts as a portal,"
Willie explained.</p>
<p>"Why cant we come here from other places? Is there something special
about this place?"</p>
<p>"Stop asking questions," Willie said sternly. "Brother Qian, lie down
in this compartment now."</p>
<p>I lay inside the horse while Willie, fully naked, straddled my lower
abdomen, placing my penis inside her. She drove the horse into a wild
gallop. At first, it was exhilarating, but when the horse leaped over
large trenches and landed heavily, Willies body pressed down on me
painfully. Despite my discomfort, Willie was ecstatic. I repeatedly
asked her to stop, and she finally did, though she complained, "There’s
still so much more to do! We still have to go over stairs, through fire,
and wade through water..."</p>
<p>"I don’t want to continue. Let’s do something else. How about you lay
inside the horse, and I ride on you?"</p>
<p>"Lets move on to the next activity." It was clear Willie wasnt keen
on the idea of me riding her.</p>
<p>Willie made a motion in the air, summoning a virtual computer that
appeared like smoke. I saw an image of a naked couple embracing,
enclosed in a giant transparent sphere rolling down like a bowling
ball.</p>
<p>"Let’s choose this one."</p>
<p>Willie hesitated, "We’ve done this before."</p>
<p>"I wasn’t ready last time, and my penis wasn’t inside you. This time
it’ll be different. Let’s do this."</p>
<p>Willie agreed to my suggestion and pressed a button on the virtual
computer. Instantly, we were in a new environment. Under something
resembling a streetlamp, I sat naked on the ground while Willie, also
naked, straddled me. We held each other tightly.</p>
<p>The streetlamp-like structure released a transparent liquid that
covered us, quickly forming a large, soft, and elastic sphere. Despite
the tight space inside, the softness of the material allowed us some
movement. We rolled downhill, bouncing rhythmically as we hit stairs,
which was thrilling. When we hit a large rock, the sphere bounced high,
making Willie scream with excitement. At times, the sphere fell freely,
giving us a sense of weightlessness. After a few minutes, the sphere
turned into liquid and flowed away.</p>
<p>Still exhilarated, Willie searched the virtual computer for similar
activities and chose an adventure involving a journey inside a human
body. I suggested using an Earth human model, and Willie agreed. Naked
again, Willie straddled me, and we held each other tightly, standing on
the teeth of a giant human. Willie instructed me to jump down. Though
hesitant at the darkness below the teeth, we jumped into the soft tongue
and mouth. Inside, it became brighter, and we could see clearly. The
giant seemed to stand up, and we fell down its throat.</p>
<p>In the stomach, the soft, dark red flesh continuously pushed against
us. We moved slowly through the intestines, which undulated
rhythmically, propelling us forward. In the rectum, the tight space and
immense pressure forced us out. Covered in sticky fluid, I thought about
how to clean ourselves, but the fluid gradually dried and peeled
off.</p>
<p>Willie then selected another sexual activity from the virtual
computer. We were sucked into a fleshy tunnel. Willie said this time we
were traveling inside a womans body. The tunnel was tight and red, with
a strong suction pulling us in. The flesh squeezed us repeatedly, which
was very stimulating. Eventually, we encountered a barrier with a small,
deep hole in the middle. Willie wanted us to squeeze through it.</p>
<p>Later, Willie chose another sex activity, but I didnt pay much
attention to what it was. We were sucked into a flesh tunnel, and Willie
said this time it was a journey inside an Earth womans body. The tunnel
was red and tight, and a strong suction force pulled us inside. We were
repeatedly rubbed by the flesh, which felt very stimulating. Then, we
encountered a fleshy barrier with a small, deep hole in the middle.
Willie wanted us to squeeze through that hole.</p>
<p>It took a lot of effort to get through. Inside was a warm, thick, and
transparent liquid that felt extremely comfortable. However, I had to
stick my head out of the hole to breathe, while Willie seemed to be
perfectly fine and enjoying herself. Eventually, we got out, and the
sticky liquid came out with us, making it easier to pass through the
tight tunnel due to the lubrication. I began to feel tired, but Willie
was still very excited. I suggested we go back as she searched for the
next activity.</p>
<p>Willie didnt want to leave. She said, "I know how to quickly
replenish your energy." She operated the virtual screen, and a
cylindrical object surrounded me, appearing virtual as well. I soon fell
asleep, and when I woke up, Willie was beside me. I felt incredibly
refreshed and asked what had happened.</p>
<p>"This is a relaxation activity combining GMW and GIW to rejuvenate
both the mind and body," Willie explained.</p>
<p>"Do you need a break too?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No need. This level of activity is nothing for us Guokers," Willie
replied, refusing my suggestion and continuing to search for the next
activity on the GIW.</p>
<p>Next, we went on a roller-coaster-like ride. I lay in a cart while
Willie rode on me, and we spun very quickly. It wasn’t long before I
felt extremely dizzy. Willie pressed something on her ear, and it seemed
the GMW helped us stand steadily on the ground. The big wheel was still
spinning, and on Earth, we would have had to wait for it to stop
completely before getting off.</p>
<p>Then we tried bumper cars. Many Guoker couples embraced each other in
bumper cars, colliding on a large, perfectly smooth metal surface.
Willie asked me to lie down while she rode on me, driving the bumper car
aggressively. Although I found it overwhelming, I endured it because
Willie was enjoying herself so much.</p>
<p>We also tried the "rubber blimp" activity. This time, Willie lay
naked inside a rubber blimp, and I rode behind her. Many couples were
driving rubber blimps, colliding with each other about two meters above
the ground. If a couple was separated during the collision, the blimp
would stop and land. We saw many blimps descending one after
another.</p>
<p>We participated in a water balloon hitting game. There was a row of
pipes, and many couples entered them, embracing each other. Willie
pulled me into one of the pipes, straddling me and telling me to hold
her tightly as the wind was about to start. Soon, a strong gust of wind
blew us out of the pipe, and we collided with a large hanging water
balloon, breaking through and falling inside. The balloon was filled
with a warm, sticky liquid that felt very comforting. Willie pointed out
a couple nearby who hadnt hit the balloon hard enough and had fallen
back to the ground, which was both embarrassing and painful. We hugged
inside the water balloon for a while before it slowly descended, and we
got out.</p>
<p>Later, we joined a "Girlfriend Carrying" competition. Many Guoker
couples stood in designated positions, naked and embracing each other.
Willie and I also stood there, and I looked particularly noticeable
because of my height. At the signal, all the women jumped up, straddled
their mens waists, and slid downwards. As soon as the mens genitals
entered the womens bodies, they quickly pulled up the pants they had
stepped on, which had ropes attached to tie their partners securely.
This binding was crucial. Then, the men had to run, walk, and overcome
various obstacles.</p>
<p>Another sex game we participated in was "Colorful Bubbles." Many
Guoker couples embraced each other in zero gravity, surrounded by
bubbles of all kinds of colors and patterns. These bubbles were of
various shapes—spherical, cylindrical, bread-like, string-like—and
floated in the air, creating a spectacular scene. Some bubbles even
slowly passed through people’s bodies.</p>
<p>Next, we experienced an activity I couldnt name, but it seemed to be
designed by a woman. It was set in an ocean of pink flowers, with pink
gauze hanging from the sky. There were large peach blossoms everywhere,
each containing a delicate woman with a beautiful smile. I felt like I
had encountered this scene in a virtual travel before. What was this? It
resembled a wedding ceremony on Earth. Willie seemed to enjoy the
romantic setting and walked hand in hand with me along the peach blossom
path. Eventually, a huge peach blossom appeared, and Willie sat inside
it, her fair skin tinged with pink. She opened her arms, inviting me to
join her. I sat with her, embracing her as the peach blossom slowly
closed around us.</p>
<p>Willie then introduced a project called "Sex with Yourself." I was
puzzled—how could one have sex with oneself? Suddenly, a naked man
identical to me appeared. Seeing my strong resistance, Willie adjusted
something, and two more figures appeared beside the first one—one more
rugged and masculine, the other more feminine. Despite this, I still
resisted embracing them. Willie pushed me towards the middle one, and
the touch felt almost identical to touching my own body. Realizing my
continued resistance, Willie finally canceled this activity.</p>
<p>Another sex game was "Killer Tree." In a vast open field stood many
structures resembling giant trees, which, upon closer inspection, looked
like naked women made of rubber. Their hair consisted of numerous soft,
flesh-colored tubes hanging from head to foot. Willie asked me to lie
naked on the grass while she lay on top of me. We rolled on the grass,
and as we reached the giant rubber women, they came to life, wrapping us
in their soft tubes and pulling us into a fleshy cavity. We were
squeezed and rubbed by the soft flesh, with sticky liquid and many soft
tubes creating intense pleasure. Eventually, I couldnt hold back and
ejaculated, feeling utterly exhausted.</p>
<p>Willie touched her ear, possibly to contact the GMW, and we were
transported back to her place without passing through the sex clubs
entrance.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-33---hurt-by-shock-girl-and-strip-girl">Chapter 33 -
Hurt by Shock Girl and Strip Girl</h2>
<p>Once, Norton invited me, Willie, and Suldair to a private club that
only admitted invited guests. Willie stood in front of the virtual
computer, and her figure appeared on the virtual screen. The Guoker
virtual computer and GIW are quite impressive. Willie used the GIW
virtual screen as a mirror, inspecting her front and back, suggesting
she wanted to be well-prepared for the party.</p>
<p>Willie and I teleported via GMW to the front door of the private club
where Suldair and Norton were waiting. I noticed their outfits were very
short and revealing that day.</p>
<p>Norton pressed something near his ear, and suddenly, we were inside
the club, likely because the club owner approved Norton’s request.</p>
<p>Inside, the atmosphere was filled with low, monotonous music. Men and
women, mostly half-naked, wore even smaller virtual clothes than usual.
Some were entirely naked. Their skin colors had changed—some glowed
brightly, while others emitted a soft light. The dim environment was
occasionally pierced by bright white beams of light. Couples danced in a
corner, their images projected as large, vivid holograms in the air by
virtual projectors. Willie and Norton each took a small, glowing stick
and inserted it into their arms. The sticks tip emitted blue and cyan
light beams, making them look ghostly.</p>
<p>Willie told me, "You cant use this. Your body structure is different
and cant handle it. I’ll give you something else."</p>
<p>She brought some metallic liquid and applied it to the back of my
hands and shoulders. In the dark, I glowed blue too, but not as brightly
as Willie and her friends.</p>
<p>They also took cup-like objects that emitted blue smoke instead of
containing drinks. Willie and Norton occasionally inhaled the smoke
through their noses. Willie explained that the smoke made people high
and altered their moods, but it wasnt suitable for Earth people.</p>
<p>Norton asked Willie to keep an eye on me and not let me wander off.
Soon, Norton and Suldair disappeared. Willie, excited, pulled me through
the crowd. Then, she asked me to stay put and wait for her.</p>
<p>Willie was gone for a long time. I stood there awkwardly, which drew
the attention of two Guoker women. They had their arms around each other
and carried devices playing rhythmic, annoying music of blips and
hisses. They saw me, and one stopped while the other circled around due
to inertia before stopping. They observed and whispered about me, and
the GIW servant Kevin translated their conversation:</p>
<p>"Hes really tall, definitely an alien."</p>
<p>"Hes got a big build, obviously a man."</p>
<p>"Lets capture him, rape him, and get inside him. It must feel
different!"</p>
<p>"I love trying new things!"</p>
<p>"This is a rare chance. We cant let it go!"</p>
<p>A very slender woman approached me. She was about one meter tall,
with a waist so thin it was almost the same width as my arm. She wore a
very short skirt and was bare-chested, with two small, elongated breasts
hanging down her chest, tied together with a colorful ribbon. Her hair
was extremely smooth, like tubes, with white ring-like patterns,
indicating she belonged to the "smooth type" of women. Her body was
light blue and smooth like jade, so polished it reflected light. Her
limbs and waist moved like a snake, flexible and seemingly boneless. Her
face was narrow, with large, elongated eyes that extended to the sides
of her face at a 45-degree angle. Her pupils were bright red, giving her
a piercing look. Under the dim light, she suddenly opened her mouth
wide, revealing many thin, soft, blood-red tentacles writhing inside,
making her look like a living ghost.</p>
<p>She pressed her ear for a moment and said something to the other
woman. The GIW servant Kevin translated for me: "Request to move the
alien via GMW was not approved?"</p>
<p>I realized she had tried to request GMW to abduct me, but her request
had been denied. Knowing her plan had failed, she moved closer, perhaps
intending to take matters into her own hands.</p>
<p>Kevin urgently warned me: "The one approaching you is Strip Girl.
Intention: sexual assault. Recommend immediate escape."</p>
<p>I didnt move, worried that Willie wouldnt be able to find me if I
did. As she got closer, Kevins warnings became more pressing: "Alien,
leave now. You are in danger of being sexually assaulted. Possible
damage: mechanical injury."</p>
<p>I remained still, finding her appearance both frightening and
extremely alluring. Despite her ghostly look, her smooth, glowing skin
and sensual figure were highly tempting. Kevin mentioned she only
intended to rape me without other harm, so I thought it might be an
exciting experience, especially since I had recently been engaged in
virtual sex and killing games, which seemed relatively safe. However, as
she approached to embrace me, the strong, pungent odor she emitted, like
the smell of stinkbugs commonly found in the countryside, was
overwhelmingly repulsive. Driven by instinctual fear, I stepped back to
avoid her grasp.</p>
<p>Another woman quickly approached. She had a fuller figure, with thick
thighs, large, short breasts, wide hips, but very small hands and feet.
Her extremely thin waist contrasted sharply with her other body parts,
making her look "brutal."</p>
<p>The GIW customer service voice came rapidly: "Shock Girl, intent on
sexual assault. Possible damage: electric burns. Alien must leave
immediately."</p>
<p>It was too late. Shock Girl hugged me tightly from behind, and I
immediately felt an electric shock that paralyzed my limbs. Strip Girl,
with frog-like agility, jumped and wrapped her legs around my waist. In
that split second, her virtual clothes disappeared. Her skin felt like
cold, slippery eels, both slick and hard. Her legs slid from my chest
down to my waist, and finally to my groin.</p>
<p>My little brother slowly entered the strip girls lower body. It felt
like penetrating an extremely soft, lubricated, and powerful
suction-like flesh tunnel. Her two elongated breasts wrapped around my
waist like a pair of arms. Whether it was due to the electricity from
the electric girl behind me or not, I felt an immense pleasure, an
extraordinary joy that I had never experienced before. The warning from
the GIW was nonsense. If I had heeded Kevins advice and escaped, how
could I have felt such an extreme pleasure now?</p>
<p>However, something soon felt off. I sensed a soft tube entering my
anus. The electric and strip girls embraced me with their four arms,
plus the strip girls two long breasts, making it feel like six arms were
holding me. I couldnt turn around to see what was entering my anus. The
GIW screen showed us three tangled together, but I couldnt make out what
was drilling into me.</p>
<p>I tried with all my might to use my willpower to stop the flesh tube
from entering my anus, but it was futile. As it continued to penetrate,
another wave of extreme pleasure hit me, an almost unbearable sensation.
The strip girl kissed me, and many soft, thin tubes with a hot, fishy
stench extended from her mouth into my throat, reaching my stomach. The
tube in my anus also quickly burrowed upward until they connected,
intertwining inside me, making it feel like I was being bound from
within. It was bizarre; the intense stench made me nauseous, but it
coexisted with extreme pleasure.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and was shocked to see that the strip girls body had
become even smaller. Her body could actually deform and gradually invade
my insides through my mouth and anus, making my stomach and intestines
feel incredibly full. Eventually, she completely entered my body, making
me feel much heavier.</p>
<p>At the peak of my pleasure, a sudden shout startled me. Kevin
translated, "Let him go immediately!"</p>
<p>I saw Norton and Suldair standing before us. The electric girl
released me and fled instantly. I immediately felt my body become
heavier, and without her support, I could barely stand. The strip girl
also attempted to flee, but her body was stuck inside mine.</p>
<p>I saw flesh tubes rapidly exit my mouth and anus, one after another,
retaining their blue, jade-like smoothness. Eventually, these strips
fused together, reforming into the strip girl who quickly got up and ran
away.</p>
<p>I began to feel intense pain in my mouth and anus, which soon spread
to my stomach and intestines. The pain became so unbearable that I had
to squat down. Blood flowed profusely from my anus, likely due to the
strip girls rapid exit, which caused significant damage.</p>
<p>Norton pressed his hand to his ear for a moment, possibly contacting
Willie. She arrived, looking shocked at the sight of blood running down
my legs and pooling on the floor. Norton decided to end our private
gathering and take me to a hospital on Guoker Planet.</p>
<p>Through the GMW, we quickly arrived at one of the hospitals on Guoker
Planet. The hospital was enormous and tall, with few people inside and a
serene atmosphere. A massive cylindrical device stood before us, roughly
the size of a house on Earth. Willie helped me lie down in a large hole
in the center of the device.</p>
<p>Willie explained, "This is the artificial information field scanner.
We Guokers rely on this to cure diseases. This machine can treat any
illness, including injuries. It can heal any acute or chronic conditions
you might have. Just a few sessions in this machine, and you will be
completely cured."</p>
<p>I thought Willie was comforting me. While I was inside the cylinder,
a faint electrical current coursed through my body, creating a ticklish
sensation. It started from my head, moved to my chest, then to my
abdomen, down to my legs, and finally to my feet. After a few seconds,
the sensation disappeared. When I emerged, all my pain and discomfort
were gone. The artificial information field scanning machine was truly
amazing! I couldnt stop asking questions.</p>
<p>“To heal with the artificial information field, you need both
hardware—the artificial information field generator—and software, which
is the computer program that controls the generator,” Norton explained.
“This hospital didn’t have a program for treating Earthlings in their
artificial information field scanner. Luckily, I managed to search and
download the necessary program from the GIW, which cured Qian.”</p>
<p>“How can the artificial information field scanning machine heal so
quickly and completely?” I asked.</p>
<p>Norton elaborated, “Under the control of computer programs, the
artificial field can precisely identify, sort, and remove molecules and
atoms at high speed. For instance, it can teleport an object molecule by
molecule at an extremely high speed. The artificial information field
generator can also perform precise cutting, moving, cold-welding,
assembling, local heating, and cooling. It can teleport parts of an
object internally without damaging its exterior or structure. This means
it can remove objects from a sealed environment without breaking the
seal. For example, it can extract anything from the human body without
the need for surgery. The field scanner can perform precise internal
operations.”</p>
<p>I was still curious, “What is the basic principle behind these
artificial field scanner machines?”</p>
<p>Suldair explained, “In the universe, there are primarily
electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, and nuclear force fields.
Gravitational fields have a wide-ranging effect, can penetrate matter,
and apply forces to all objects, but they are relatively weak.
Electromagnetic fields are strong but have poor penetration and short
range. They also only interact with certain materials, leaving others
unaffected.”</p>
<p>“If people understand the essence of these fields, they can create an
artificial field that combines the universal influence of gravitational
fields with the strength of electromagnetic fields. This artificial
field, controlled by computer programs, is known as the artificial
information field. Its fundamental principle is to use this artificial
field to excite matter to a state of zero mass,” Suldair continued.</p>
<p>Norton added, “In the future, Earth will also have artificial
information fields for medical treatments. Not only will chronic
diseases like cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and Alzheimers be fully
cured, but infectious diseases and injuries will also be treatable. The
advent of artificial information field technology on Earth will herald
an era of non-chemical therapy.”</p>
<p>Back at Willie’s house, I marveled at the artificial information
field scanner in the hospital. Willie mentioned, “The artificial
information field scanning device can also help with weight loss,
enhancing facial beauty, and body sculpting. Only the artificial
information field can allow people to achieve their desired body shape
effortlessly. Women, in particular, will truly love the artificial
information field scanner.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-34---visiting-neighboring-planets">Chapter 34 - Visiting
Neighboring Planets</h2>
<p>I learned from conversations with Norton that Guoker Planet is
surrounded by dozens of planets, much like our Solar Systems eight major
planets orbiting the Sun. These planets, including many with moons,
revolve around a massive star similar to our Sun.</p>
<p>Their civilization began on one of these planets. After inventing
light-speed flying saucers, they started large-scale development of
neighboring planets. Most of the planets near Guoker have been developed
into habitable zones, with many already populated.</p>
<p>One time, Norton, Suldair, Willie, and I took a flying saucer to
visit several nearby planets.</p>
<p>Our first stop was the Garbage Planet. This planet was piled with
waste, and the air was thin and unbreathable. The flying saucer hovered
above it while Norton and Suldair disembarked. Willie stayed with me on
the saucer.</p>
<p>Willie explained, "Guoker Planet has extremely high environmental
standards. Much of our waste, especially decommissioned flying saucers,
is transported to this Garbage Planet for decomposition and processing.
Useful materials are then shipped back for reuse. Most of the work on
Garbage Planet is done by robots, remotely operated by people on Guoker
Planet."</p>
<p>Our second stop was a giant planet where the saucer hovered in a
holding pattern. The planet was covered with tall, densely packed
metallic buildings, giving it a silver appearance but a desolate feel.
Despite my efforts, I couldnt spot any vegetation.</p>
<p>"This is our home planet, the Silver Planet," Norton said, surprising
me. "We Guoker people originated here. It used to be green and full of
life, like your Earth. Sadly, a prolonged nuclear war, lasting over a
century by Earth’s time, almost destroyed it. The surface became
uninhabitable, forcing people to move underground.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, we deciphered the nature of fields and invented the
flying saucer. We first developed Guoker Planet, transforming its
environment to make it livable. Now, it’s our main planet and the center
of our power and technology, governing the other planets. The Silver
Planet is now mainly inhabited by virtual people and those who live
permanently underground."</p>
<p>The flying saucer entered the Silver Planet through a tunnel. Inside,
Norton gave me a ring to wear around my neck, explaining that the
underground air might not be suitable for Earth people. This ring
blocked air from entering my nose and mouth and used the saucers
artificial field scanning device to teleport oxygen into my body.</p>
<p>We disembarked the saucer and boarded another type of vehicle,
similar to a convertible car but without wheels, hovering about two
meters (6.6 feet) above the ground. It moved slowly, providing an
excellent view for sightseeing. The interior of the Silver Planet
resembled a centipedes body, with a vast main hall connected to numerous
smaller tunnels. I heard from them that there are still main cave halls
under this hall, and there are many layers. We also saw huge underground
spaces from time to time. In this underground space, we could see many
green and yellow plants and strange scenery. Their colors were extremely
bright, as if they were shining under the sun. However, it gave me a
feeling of depression. I still felt that the space was not big enough
and it did not give me the comfortable feeling of living under the blue
sky and white clouds.</p>
<p>We saw many virtual people walking along the walls of the main hall,
and light-based virtual beings passed through our bodies, which was both
eerie and fascinating. In the dim light of the smaller tunnel entrances,
we noticed many strange reptiles. They quickly retreated into smaller
holes upon noticing us.</p>
<p>Leaving the Silver Planet behind, we flew to the "Primitive Tribe
Planet" in our flying saucer.</p>
<p>Norton introduced it, saying, "Most residents of the Primitive Tribe
Planet are immigrants from Guoker Planet. On Guokers GIW, theres a forum
called I am Tribal, which serves as the authority and base camp for the
Primitive Tribe Planet. They worship a primitive lifestyle and oppose
modern technology, yet ironically, they cant live without some basic
technological products. The I am Tribal forum played a major role in
developing the Primitive Tribe Planet."</p>
<p>The planets surface was covered with numerous plants, and the scenery
was breathtaking. Suldair flew the saucer at an extremely low altitude.
Norton cautioned, "Be careful. The inhabitants of the Primitive Tribe
Planet are known for attacking outsiders. They are unfriendly, not only
opposing technology but also hating all forms of laws and restrictions.
They uphold the law of the jungle, and its common for them to kill each
other."</p>
<p>Indeed, we saw exposed corpses on the ground, starkly contrasting
with the beautiful environment. The bones of these bodies were clearly
visible.</p>
<p>Norton explained, "I am Tribal members have their bodies custom-made
on Guoker Planet. Their bodies have bones and require food to survive.
Unlike them, we dont need bones or food; our nutrition is provided
automatically by the GMW artificial field programs. Since the Primitive
Tribe Planet lacks artificial field equipment and the GMW, they must
consume food to maintain their energy, just like people on Earth."</p>
<p>We observed that the people on the Primitive Tribe Planet varied
greatly in size, shape, and appearance. Their clothes were tattered, and
nearly everyone carried weapons—ranging from swords and arrows to
firearms and other advanced weapons I couldnt identify.</p>
<p>Curious, I asked, "What happens if they die in battle?"</p>
<p>"Their consciousness is backed up on Guoker Planet," Norton
explained. "If they die, they can be resurrected immediately on Guoker
Planet. The I am Tribal forum has satellites in orbit around the
Primitive Tribe Planet that use artificial field scanning to monitor the
inhabitants. They are instantly notified whenever someone dies."</p>
<p>Suldair added disdainfully, "If they want to die, they can always
come back here to keep fighting."</p>
<p>Willie remarked, "The Primitive Tribe Planet has no artificial field,
GMW, or GIW services. Their biggest challenge is finding enough food to
survive. The living conditions are harsh, so its hard to understand why
anyone would choose to live here. Maybe they have a deep-seated desire
to kill real people rather than just in virtual games. They dont get the
opportunity to kill elsewhere, but here they can."</p>
<p>Suldair laughed, "And they get killed themselves, ha-ha!"</p>
<p>We left the Primitive Tribe Planet and arrived at the Flower Planet.
It was a spectacular sight, with all kinds of plants and flowers
creating a sea of blooms. We strolled through it, enjoying the sweet
fragrance in the air. They asked me to stand alone in a patch of red
flowers for a photo. I didnt see them use a camera, so they must have
had some advanced way of taking pictures.</p>
<p>Norton asked, "These red flowers were introduced from your Earth. Do
you know what they are?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea. Ive seen these flowers in my hometown, but I dont
know their name."</p>
<p>"Theyre called crape myrtles on Earth," Norton explained. "Many
Guoker people come here to relax and unwind. Its a great place."</p>
<p>"But people tend to get tired of it if they stay too long," Suldair
remarked.</p>
<p>"I agree," Willie added.</p>
<p>We flew near a relatively small planet. Suldair piloted the saucer to
hover above it, and Norton instructed us not to land. He explained that
this planet was the farthest from the star at the center of the Guoker
system and served as the systems early warning center, monitoring for
visitors from other parts of the universe.</p>
<p>The buildings on this planet were peculiar, stretching horizontally
for long distances. I assumed this was because the planet had low
gravity, making it easier for such structures to remain stable without
collapsing under their own weight.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/fND5pix3tIWGQHs.png" width="323" height="192"></p>
<p>Figure: Three buildings with "houses extending horizontally for a
long distance," two in the foreground and one in the background</p>
<p>We flew to a small planet and saw the wreckage of a huge flying
saucer, covered in thick dust. Suldair piloted our saucer close to the
crashed saucer and activated the scanning device to scan its interior.
On the virtual screen, we saw the inside of the crashed saucer,
revealing human skeletons.</p>
<p>Norton said, "These people were pioneers of our early exploration
efforts. At that time, we Guokers didnt have the ability to back up our
consciousness. These people died and cannot be revived; they are our
true heroes."</p>
<p>On a desolate planet, we saw traces of artificial structures. Norton
said, "This planet is one of our early failed attempts at terraforming.
The Guokers initially chose small planets, thinking it would be cheaper,
but that was a mistake. Small planets cant easily retain an atmosphere.
Although using artificial fields to trap air is convenient, if they
malfunction, all the air escapes, leading to disastrous
consequences."</p>
<p>Indeed, we saw on the hologram many skeletons in pairs inside
buildings on this planet.</p>
<p>Norton said, "This is a typical result of an artificial field
failure. The air vanished instantly, and the inhabitants, realizing they
were doomed, chose to die embracing their loved ones. Early Guoker space
exploration was fraught with life-threatening risks. Nowadays, we mainly
assign virtual light beings to live on small planets."</p>
<p>Our saucer then reached the surface of a massive planet. Norton said
this was called the Mineral Planet, a primary mining site for early
Guokers.</p>
<p>"With technological advancements, Guokers could easily transform
elements into others at low costs. Precious metals and gems, like those
on Earth, became as worthless as dirt in the Guoker system. Eventually,
people abandoned mining here, leaving the planet desolate."</p>
<p>The Mineral Planet had many moons. Norton said there were dozens of
moons the size of Earth. Some had been developed and populated, while
others were still under construction. We flew past the Mineral Planet to
the Lovers Planets, two nearly identical planets orbiting each other and
the star.</p>
<p>Willie said, "These are called the Lovers Planets, but some used to
call them the Sisters Planets. As Guokers learned to clone themselves,
the concept of sisters faded, and they became known as the Lovers
Planets. One planet is black, and the other is white, often referred to
as the Black and White Twins, with the black one being male and the
white one female. The Lovers Planets are far from Guoker but close to
our home planet, Silver Planet. In the Silver Planet era, poets,
singers, and lovers frequently used the Lovers Planets as metaphors for
love, which eventually became clichéd."</p>
<p>I commented, "Just like how we Earth people use the Moon as a
metaphor for love."</p>
<p>Suldair said, "People from the Silver Planet era were captivated by
the Lovers Planets. Countless writers depicted them as paradises for
lovers. They imagined that there were many beautiful boys and girls
there, and that these people did not have to work hard and can just play
all day long, enjoying the pleasure of sexual intercourse between men
and women. They believed that if a man lost his beloved, he could find
her on the White Planet, and if a woman lost her beloved, she could find
him on the Black Planet. However, when our technology was advanced
enough to visit the Lovers Planets, we found them both to be desolate,
with nothing but different surface materials reflecting light
differently."</p>
<p>Our flying saucer glided above the surface of the black planet. We
saw the enormous white planet hanging in the sky, looking as if it might
fall at any moment, moving slowly across the sky. Norton said that the
black and white twin planets complete an orbit around each other in less
time than it takes for the Moon to orbit Earth.</p>
<p>Suldair said, "The Guoker people are now massively developing the
Lovers Planets. There are countless advertisements on the Guoker GIW,
promoting the Lovers Planets as the perfect choice for couples. However,
not many people choose to live there permanently, so the Lovers Planets
arent very populated. The conditions there are not ideal. Sometimes the
days are too long and the nights are too short, and other times the days
are too short and the nights are too long. The other planet reflects
sunlight at night and blocks sunlight during the day, making it hard to
distinguish day from night. Additionally, the infrastructure is not
well-developed, so few people are willing to stay there long-term."</p>
<p>Our saucer passed over the surface of the white planet, where we saw
the enormous black planet looming above. The white planets surface was
silvery-white, while the black planet was a dark, gloomy color. I
thought that the numerous shadows cast by the black planets mountains
might contribute to its dark appearance. We did not land on the Lovers
Planets and instead headed to our next destination.</p>
<p>We flew to one of the industrial planets in the Guoker System. There
were no chimneys on the industrial planets; instead, they were filled
with tall metallic buildings and densely packed factories. Norton said
that the industrial planets had no atmosphere and were operated by
remotely controlled robots. After visiting the industrial planet, we
flew back to Guoker Planet, leaving many other planets unvisited.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-35---kidnapped-on-water-planet">Chapter 35 - Kidnapped
on Water Planet</h2>
<p>There is a huge planet near Guoker Planet, almost entirely covered
with water. Norton and his fellows call it the Water Planet. Once,
Norton, Suldair, Willie, and I went to explore the Water Planet on a
flying saucer.</p>
<p>The flying saucer jumped from Guoker Planet to the Water Planet
instantly. It hovered over the Water Planet for a while, probably
because Norton’s team was choosing a landing site. According to the
video from Kevin, the flying saucer seemed to descend slowly, but when
it touched the waters surface, I still felt an incredible speed.
Miraculously, there was no splash; it entered the water silently, like a
puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Underwater, a 3D virtual screen appeared inside the flying saucer,
showing everything around us. We moved very slowly, and the surroundings
were clearly visible. The ocean was filled with dense, tall plants and
various kinds of fish swimming around. Norton pointed at a creature
resembling a shark and said, "This isnt an ordinary fish. Inside its
belly hides an advanced intelligent human. Its a water-based parasitic
race introduced from another planet into the Guoker System. Look at its
eyes; they have human-like expressions, completely different from
ordinary fish."</p>
<p>Willie said, "Brother Qian, when we played at the bottom of the ocean
on Guoker Planet, we encountered this kind of fish. It even followed us.
If you get caught by it, youre in trouble."</p>
<p>I asked, "Where did the humans on the Water Planet come from? Are
they from your Guoker Planet, or are they native to this planet?"</p>
<p>Norton explained, "In the very early days, the Water Planet only had
primitive life forms like viruses, but they never evolved into
intelligent beings. When Guoker technology advanced enough to develop
light-speed flying saucers, we frequently visited nearby planets and
became familiar with the Water Planet.</p>
<p>"One tribe on GIW, called I Belong to Water Planet, made great
efforts to introduce many species to the Water Planet. Some of these
species were kidnapped from distant planets in the universe, especially
the water-based parasitic humans, who were modified and released on the
Water Planet. Many tribe members even modified their own bodies to live
as parasites in the bellies of large fish, allowing them to live
permanently in the ocean world."</p>
<p>Suldair added, "Qian, the translation you hear is from our flying
saucers equipment. The Water Planet has no GMW or GIW service. Those
people who chose to live in the Water Planets oceans are really asking
for trouble. I dont understand their reasoning. I visited the I Belong
to Water Planet tribe on GIW. They said the Water Planet has vast oceans
and few people. The hardest part of living there is the lack of
opposite-sex partners. Although they can invite people from Guoker
Planet, it rarely works. Very few respond to them."</p>
<p>Willie said, "There are more women than men living in the oceans of
the Water Planet. These ocean women are very interested in men from
Guoker Planet. Once they find one, theyll do everything they can to lure
and capture him. Once caught, these poor Guoker men become sex slaves.
Especially you, Brother Qian, since youre tall and unique, you’ll be
particularly interesting to them. Be careful; you’re their top target.
These ocean women are very cunning."</p>
<p>Sure enough, several shark-like fish were slowly following our flying
saucer. Norton told Suldair to be cautious. Suldair dismissed it,
saying, "What can these big fish do to us?"</p>
<p>Norton responded, "Some of these ocean dwellers have been living on
the ocean floor for thousands of years. They are highly evolved and
intelligent. You never know what tricks they might pull. If something
goes wrong, our bodies and consciousness are backed up on Guoker Planet,
so we’ll be fine. But Brother Qian wont survive; he would lose his life.
Willie is right; these ocean dwellers are very cunning. We need to be
very careful."</p>
<p>Suldair agreed, "Youre right. Ill drive carefully and avoid dangerous
areas."</p>
<p>I asked, "How do these ocean dwellers communicate with the I Belong
to Water Planet tribe on GIW? How do they send their information to
GIW?"</p>
<p>Norton explained, "Previously, the ocean dwellers recorded their
information, and members of the I Belong to Water Planet tribe would
come here in flying saucers to collect it and then post it on GIW. But
now, according to comments from the I Belong to Water Planet tribe
forum, they have solved the problem of instant communication between
Guoker and Water Planet. Many ocean dwellers now have their bodies
wirelessly connected to the Guoker GIW. Our mission today is to study
these ocean dwellers."</p>
<p>We explored the ocean floor for a long time before Norton said,
"Theres a small island nearby. Let’s go check it out. Qian, put this
device around your neck. Our flying saucer will remotely provide you
with oxygen, as you Earth people cannot breathe the air on Water
Planet."</p>
<p>Willie took a half-ring-shaped device from Norton and handed it to
me. I put it around my neck, likely to prevent me from inhaling Water
Planets air. Suldair drove the flying saucer out of the water and into
the air. We saw a small island from above and hovered about one meter
above the ground before descending from the saucer.</p>
<p>The island was small and low-lying, with little vegetation, as if it
was frequently washed by ocean water. The island was covered in traces
of water erosion. The soil on the island was similar to a kind of white
clay found on Earth, mostly gray-white.</p>
<p>Norton said, "This islands soil is high in a substance that easily
dissolves in water, much like sand. The Water Planet is almost entirely
made of this soil, which is why it has very little land. The land gets
dissolved by the ocean water."</p>
<p>As I wandered near the shore, Willie warned, "Brother Qian, stay away
from the water. If one of those intelligent parasitic fish swallows you,
youll become their sex slave, and theres nothing we can do to help."</p>
<p>Willies warning scared me, so I immediately moved away from the
shore. On the island, I saw many large holes filled with water. The
edges of the holes were surrounded by mounds of soil, looking as if
something had been burrowing through them repeatedly.</p>
<p>I asked, "How were these holes formed? They look like the burrows
made by ricefield eels on Earth, but much larger."</p>
<p>Suldair said, "We’re not sure. It seems they were made by some kind
of creature."</p>
<p>Willie suggested, "Could they be caused by volcanic activity?"</p>
<p>Norton said, "It doesnt look like volcanic activity. It’s more likely
that a large animal made them."</p>
<p>I walked to the largest hole and crouched down to take a closer look.
Suddenly, the water in the hole began to rapidly drain, and the ground
beneath me collapsed. I fell into the hole.</p>
<p>A powerful suction pulled me deeper into the hole before I could call
for help. The tunnel inside the hole was much larger and connected to
the ocean. In the clear ocean water, I saw a giant shark-like fish open
its mouth, and I was helplessly drawn towards it.</p>
<p>As I neared its mouth, the white mud on my body was quickly washed
away, and the virtual mist around my waist disappeared, leaving me
completely naked. The giant fish stopped inhaling, and due to inertia, I
was washed into its belly, where there was a hole. Although the fit was
tight, the suction was so strong that I was pulled inside the fish’s
belly.</p>
<p>The water was cold, but it felt warmer once I was inside the fish.
The ring gadget on my neck fell off, and I could’t breathe, feeling like
I was suffocating. Suddenly, a soft tube latched onto my head and
expanded, allowing me to breathe again. I still felt the suction pulling
me, and my body continued to move by inertia, bringing back the cold
sensation.</p>
<p>When my body finally stopped, I heard a strange, enchanting music
coming from all around me. A light blue glow, like that of a fluorescent
lamp, illuminated the space inside the fish’s belly. The light didn’t
come from a single point but appeared everywhere within. The tube
covering my head was transparent, and I saw a small, seductive woman
sitting in the center of the fish’s belly. Was this the advanced ocean
dweller Willie had mentioned? I had been captured. Could I return? I
felt anxious, scared, and distressed.</p>
<p>The woman was about 70 to 80 centimeters tall (27.5 to 31.5 inches).
She was naked, her body white and translucent with a slight blue-green
tint, extremely smooth like white jade or jelly, and seemingly boneless.
Two small, pointed breasts protruded from her chest like horns. Her
black, shiny hair was tightly bound together, resembling the back of a
snakehead fish, tapering down behind her.</p>
<p>Her eyes were large, but her nose and mouth were very small. Her face
was relatively flat with little contour, and her eyes were crystal
clear. However, the outer corners of her eyes curved upwards, giving her
an evil and alluring look. She sat on the belly of the big fish, with a
thick fleshy tube connecting her body to the fish.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/2azfUkyq6YEFvsg.png" width="147" height="288"></p>
<p>Figure: The face of the fish woman (he drew it three times)</p>
<p>The cavity inside the fishs belly was low, so I could only crouch. I
saw the woman with a look of desire for the opposite sex, a look that
was similar to women on Earth and Guoker Planet. She was talking, but I
couldnt understand her. My ears couldnt pick up the translation from
GIW, indicating I was out of the GIW service range. I couldnt contact
Norton or get any help from them. What should I do?</p>
<p>The woman looked as weak as a child on Earth. What if I strangled her
and forced her to put me back on the island? I moved towards her, drawn
by her smile or seductive laugh. I intended to strangle her, but as soon
as I touched her body, I was hit by a jolt of electricity, and the
surrounding light dimmed momentarily. I fell on my back. The woman
leaped up, spread her legs, and sat on my chest. Her skin felt as smooth
as a wet eel.</p>
<p>Her vagina was right in front of me, and I saw it split open,
revealing many greenish tubes of varying lengths and thicknesses, which
looked soft. The tubes had a light cyan and purple-red color at their
tips. These tubes twisted together like a bunch of venomous snakes,
writhing and ready to strike.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the tubes sprayed a thick, hot green liquid all over me. I
felt an immediate rush of energy, like I was on a stimulant. The woman
pressed her groin tightly against my chest and then slowly moved
backward to my waist and groin. My penis entered her vagina, and the
soft tubes inside immediately wrapped around it, sending waves of
intense pleasure through me.</p>
<p>Transparent liquid dripped from her eyes onto my chest and quickly
absorbed into my body, unleashing another wave of powerful energy. The
pleasure was so overwhelming that I could hardly bear it, but a wave of
sleepiness also washed over me.</p>
<p>At some point, I felt a tube enter my anus, jolting me awake. Fear
gripped me as I tried to resist the tubes advance into my body, but it
was futile. Sleepiness overtook me again, and the tube continued to
burrow deeper into my body, injecting warm, sticky liquid. I felt surges
of immense strength wave after wave as the tube crawled through my
intestines, stomach, and finally into my mouth.</p>
<p>When I woke up, the transparent tube on my head was gone. The woman
had left my body, but a thick green tube still connected us through my
anus. I felt something like a second tongue in my mouth. I spat it out
and was horrified to see a green tube protruding. I was also shocked to
see a thin green tube extending from my penis.</p>
<p>Seeing me awake, the woman became excited, spread her legs, and
numerous tubes emerged from her groin, dancing in the air. These tubes
then latched onto my body, sucking everywhere. The tube inside me seemed
to branch out, and it felt like countless gentle hands were caressing my
body inside and out. The pleasure was indescribable. Then, the tubes
sprayed more hot, sticky liquid. I closed my eyes, overwhelmed by the
ecstasy, until suddenly, a strong force pushed me, and I was
inexplicably thrown out of the big fishs body.</p>
<p>In the clear water, I saw that the green tube was still connected to
my anus. The green, sticky liquid on my body was dispersing into the
cold water, which felt like countless needles pricking my skin. It was
unbearably painful. Strangely, I didnt need to breathe and felt no
discomfort from it. Though my skin was cold, my insides felt warm,
probably due to the tube connected to my anus supplying me with energy.
I tried to struggle, but the tube tugged at my internal organs, causing
sharp pain. Why did this woman throw me out of the fish? Was it just to
increase my suffering?</p>
<p>I suddenly realized that I had become this womans sex slave. Would I
ever see Norton and Willie again? Could I return to Earth and reunite
with my parents? A wave of sorrow washed over me. Unable to endure the
cold water, I curled up. Suddenly, the tube in my anus yanked, sending
waves of pain through my body as I was slowly pulled back into the fishs
belly.</p>
<p>The woman, like a malicious demon, sat inside the fish, waving her
hands and speaking, though I couldnt understand her. She injected a
liquid that made my mind turn green and put me to sleep. Another liquid
turned my mind red, making me extremely excited. Most of the time, I was
unconscious, only waking when she needed sex.</p>
<p>Later, I felt the tube extend into my spine and then my brain,
allowing me to communicate with her telepathically. I could see the
ocean when I closed my eyes, although not very clearly and without
control over my view. Much like Willie had said, this woman only saw me
as a sex slave. Had she modified my body? My skin had turned green. What
had she done with those green tubes? The thought filled me with fear and
anxiety.</p>
<p>Being able to communicate with her and see the ocean somewhat eased
my mind. My desperation to escape and reunite with Norton and the others
lessened. I often held the small woman in my arms, placing her on my lap
as we roamed the ocean. I began to develop some affection for her.</p>
<p>But this didnt last long. A violent jolt woke me, sending
excruciating pain through my organs. I opened my eyes to see the woman
beside me, writhing in pain. She was curled up, trembling, and the green
tube connecting us had been cut. Our surroundings had changed; we were
now inside a large flying saucer. The fishs body lay before us, cut open
and being operated on by several robots. Soon, the fishs body was thrown
into the ocean, creating a massive splash visible on the 3D virtual
screen.</p>
<p>I saw Norton pacing and talking through GIW. A sudden intuition told
me that my capture might have been part of Nortons plan, a mere
experiment.</p>
<p>The robots placed the woman and me into separate body bags.</p>
<p>In a Guoker hospital, I met Norton, Willie, and Suldair. Norton
apologized, "Sorry for the accident. It was our oversight that put you
in danger."</p>
<p>Willie held my hand, asking with concern, "How do you feel, Brother
Qian?"</p>
<p>"Dizzy, weak, nauseous," I replied.</p>
<p>Suldair reassured me, "Youll be fine. A few scans with the artificial
information field will fix you up."</p>
<p>I lay in the scanner, and soon felt much better.</p>
<p>Willie helped me up and asked, "How do you feel now?"</p>
<p>"Much better, though still a bit dizzy, weak, and thirsty," I
answered.</p>
<p>Norton, busy operating on the virtual computer screen, pointed and
said, "Look, these colorful substances are being expelled from Qians
body. These are the handiwork of the parasitic beings from the Water
Planets ocean. His body still has issues; the artificial information
field cant fully heal him. We need to use human body vegetative
chemotherapy to completely cure him. Lets move him to the vegetative
chemotherapy hospital now."</p>
<p>At the vegetative chemotherapy hospital, I was brought next to a
large container. Norton and his team operated remotely via a virtual
screen. The top of a big black jar at my feet slowly opened. Through
GIW, Norton instructed me to jump in. Inside, I saw numerous blood-red
tubes writhing like serpents, their tips resembling gaping, bloody
mouths—truly terrifying.</p>
<p>"Damn you, Norton, are you trying to kill me?" I cursed inwardly, but
my body moved on its own, falling into the jar. It felt like falling
onto a bed of rebar. I closed my eyes, bracing for the terrifying
impact.</p>
<p>Instead, I felt many small hands supporting me. The tubes cradled,
wrapped, and sucked at my body, giving me a pleasurable sensation.
Sleepiness overcame me, and I dreamt of a tube entering my anus and
spreading throughout my body. Later, I felt liquid filling the jar,
submerging me. Though I couldnt breathe, I felt no discomfort, likely
because the tube in my anus was supplying me with energy and oxygen.</p>
<p>When I emerged from the vegetative chemotherapy hospital, I finally
felt completely healed.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-36---a-present-for-the-undersea-amphibious-giants">Chapter
36 - A Present for the Undersea Amphibious Giants</h2>
<p>When I met Norton, Suldair, and Willie again, they were discussing
the underwater parasite people of Mercury.</p>
<p>Norton mentioned that there were also many parasitic species living
in the oceans of Guoker. One of these species, an amphibious one, was
introduced from a highly advanced planet. They could live both
underwater and on land. Their home planet was technologically advanced,
with large, sophisticated buildings and equipment. In their early
development, they were not social creatures, but as they progressed to
the point where they could manufacture their own bodies, they began to
live in groups and became a highly intelligent species in the
universe.</p>
<p>Norton waved his hand, and a 3D hologram appeared, displaying a woman
who looked very similar to a human female from Earth. Norton explained
that this species had evolved from aquatic beings, but their current
body shape was designed and manufactured by the Guoker people.</p>
<p>The males of this species were very small and lived as parasites
inside the female bodies. Their home planet was vast and mostly covered
with water, making it difficult to find mates. In their early evolution,
the females were ruthless towards the males. Once a female encountered a
male, she would stop at nothing to capture him, never letting him escape
once caught. Even after they became technologically advanced and could
create tools and their own bodies, many continued the tradition of
capturing males and making them parasitic.</p>
<p>Norton concluded, "We will soon visit these amphibious parasites and
give them a gift." He glanced at me and added, "The gift is you, Brother
Qain."</p>
<p>What? My body was to be given as a gift for them to experience,
generating digital wealth for Nortons team? Norton had always deceived
me or kept me uninformed, arranging for me to be suddenly exposed to
strange women from the Guoker system, who would then experience my body
and often subject me to rough treatment.</p>
<p>Why was he being so explicit this time? Was it because these
amphibious beings resembled Earth women, making me less instinctively
repulsed? Or perhaps, as a highly intelligent species, they would treat
me with civility and gentleness rather than savagely attacking me.
However, I had no right to refuse and was fearful of Norton and his
team, so I remained silent.</p>
<p>Soon, Norton took us to the amphibious peoples colony. From the air,
we saw a ring-shaped island with beautiful scenery and fully equipped
facilities, surrounded by clear blue water. Our flying saucer dove into
the water in the center of the island. When it stopped on the ocean
floor, we stepped out into an area filled with air, not water,
surrounded by finely crafted equipment and large, beautiful
buildings.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw the ocean water floating about ten stories above
us, without any visible glass or support. It looked like clouds in the
sky, with many fish swimming overhead. It was a marvelous sight, perhaps
supported by an invisible wall.</p>
<p>Sunlight filtered through the moving water, creating shifting
patterns on the ground. The shadows of fish would occasionally cross
these patterns as they swam above. The place felt very upscale,
confirming that these amphibious beings were indeed a highly intelligent
species treated with special regard in the Guoker system.</p>
<p>However, only two robots greeted us. After speaking with Norton,
Norton instructed me to enter a room, saying that they needed to clean
my body both inside and out.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in the Guoker System, I had encountered numerous women,
each with a penchant for violently invading my body. These women were
sadistic, often bringing me moments of pleasure but predominantly
leaving me with feelings of pain, terror, and disgust. None of them
treated me with kindness. When I heard Norton intended to present me as
a gift to the amphibious people, I felt a mix of anticipation and
apprehension because I had seen holograms on GIW that depicted Guoker’s
underwater amphibious species as being similar to Earth women. I had
always wondered what it would feel like to experience genuine intimacy
with an Earth woman and longed for gentle affection.</p>
<p>However, when Norton took me to a room and instructed me to clean
myself thoroughly, both inside and out, an inexplicable fear gripped me.
Were they planning to prepare me as food for these women? I recalled a
dream in which I had been captured by a group of primitive barbarians
who cleaned me meticulously inside and out, then seasoned and roasted me
alive. Thankfully, the nightmare ended before they could eat me.</p>
<p>The rooms door seemed to be virtual. As I entered, it swiftly formed
a large opening that closed immediately behind me. The room was dimly
lit. I walked to the center, and the holograms on my body vanished,
leaving me stark naked. I felt as if I were standing on a soft rubber
surface. Numerous sticky droplets began to fall from the air onto my
bare skin.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the room was flooded with light. Several thin, black,
flexible tubes descended rapidly from above, spraying foamy water all
over me. Some tubes shaved off my body hair, leaving only very short
hair and eyebrows. Other tubes sucked onto my fingers and toes, quickly
filing down my nails. The tubes worked swiftly, cleansing my exterior in
minutes. One tube extended into my mouth, filling my insides with foamy
water, causing discomfort in my stomach due to the continuous water
pressure.</p>
<p>A black ring then enveloped my body from head to toe, descending
slowly. I felt an immense internal pressure, prompting brown excrement
to expel from my anus and yellow urine from my penis until the liquids
turned completely transparent. The black ring descended to the ground,
and the water inflow ceased, signaling the end of the cleaning
process.</p>
<p>At that moment, I felt the rubbery floor beginning to melt. My feet
sank deeper until I abruptly slid down a highly slippery, spiral
chute.</p>
<p>I landed on the ground, and as I stood up, I was surrounded by four
colossal, naked women. They immediately encircled me.</p>
<p>These women bore a strong resemblance to Earth humans, but their skin
was incredibly smooth and white, with subtle hints of light blue, making
me suspect that their blood might be blue. Their front skin was white
while their backs were glossy black, with a seamless transition between
the two colors.</p>
<p>Due to the rippling water above, light patterns danced across the
ground and the giants bodies, resembling the markings of a venomous
snake, which created an eerie and unsettling atmosphere. These women
stood around five to six meters tall (16.5 to 20 feet), undeniably
giants. They were not only tall but also remarkably robust and
voluptuous. Their large breasts, resembling huge pumpkins, were about
half a meter (20 inches) in diameter, with purple-red nipples surrounded
by fish scale-like patterns. The closer the rings were to the nipples,
the darker the color. I could discern three to four such rings. They
also had belly buttons, as large as my head, trumpet-shaped, and
seemingly bottomless. Their rounded, hefty thighs measured over one
meter (3.3 feet) in diameter.</p>
<p>Their sheer size was overwhelming. Although I had previously imagined
that they must be very large to be able to swallow a man and turn him
into a parasite, seeing them in person far exceeded my expectations.
Their sheer enormity was shocking and terrifying. Another impression
they left on me was their elegance and beauty. Their hair, resembling
seaweed, grew from their heads down to their spines, tapering in length
along the way. It looked like fins or the ruffles of agaric mushrooms,
especially below their hips, where it formed a structure akin to a fish
tail, all in a shiny black hue.</p>
<p>In their armpits and groin areas, they had numerous fleshy tendrils,
similar to the whiskers of a catfish, hanging down and intertwining. One
of them picked me up like a mother cradling a baby. Her skin was
extremely smooth but hard, even harder than Willies. She exuded a
pungent, fishy odor mixed with a sour stench that was almost
unbearable.</p>
<p>Nearly all Guoker women use their odor to control men. Initially,
their smell is nauseating, but over time, you adapt to it, and
eventually, some even come to enjoy it, becoming almost addicted. She
opened her large mouth to kiss me. Her lips were a deep purple,
shimmering with blue highlights, creating a dazzling effect. Her teeth
were small, sharp, and perfectly aligned, reminiscent of a sharks,
adding to the horror.</p>
<p>Her mouth was filled with multiple tongues, resembling the fleshy
tendrils under her arms. It looked like hundreds of snakes writhing in
her mouth. As she swallowed my head, I felt as if I were looking at a
night sky dotted with blue stars. Her tentacle-like tongues wrapped
around my head, dripping a mucus-like substance with a strong, fishy
smell.</p>
<p>She held me tightly, inverting my body, and moved me down her torso.
The stench grew stronger, clearly emanating from her lower body. Her
genital area, similar in appearance to a humans, was densely covered
with hair. Long fleshy tendrils emerged from a slit, flanked by two
thick, fleshy lips that extended from the front to the back.</p>
<p>Her external tendrils remained outside her body, unlike Willies,
which were concealed within internal cavities and could extend or
retract. Later, I learned that these giants also had numerous internal
tendrils. The external ones coiled and twisted together like strange
snakes. As she moved me closer to her groin, the stench became
unbearable, but she seemed indifferent to my revulsion.</p>
<p>The other three giant women approached, all completely naked and
without any sense of shame. They spat on me and spread their legs,
revealing long, crimson tendrils that emerged from their groins and rose
into the air, spraying a sticky, foul-smelling liquid onto me. One giant
squeezed the tip of her tendril to increase the force of the spray.
After spraying me from the front, she turned around, bent over, and
shook her hips rapidly, causing her tendrils to whip through the air,
flinging more of the viscous liquid onto my body. I was soon covered in
it, with some of it dripping off in long, sticky strings.</p>
<p>The giant woman then shoved my head into her groin tendrils. The
muscular tendrils writhed powerfully, creating a strong suction as if
swallowing me. I struggled desperately, fearing suffocation, but my
efforts were futile. She easily engulfed my head, and the slimy tendrils
inside her body rubbed against and coiled around my head and face.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it wasnt long before she pulled me out. I found myself
covered in a snot-like, white, slightly yellowish sticky liquid. As it
dripped, it formed long, unbreakable strings, indicating its high
viscosity. The strong, peculiar fishy and sour stench, somewhat like the
smell of dead lobsters, emanated from this sticky fluid. I knew she
wouldnt let me go easily, and sure enough, she inserted my feet into her
lower bodys muscular tubes again. The powerful suction dragged me inside
despite my desperate resistance. I felt an oval-shaped muscle ring
inside her, long vertically and short horizontally, which prevented my
arms from entering. The strong suction continued to pull me in, leaving
me painfully stuck.</p>
<p>At that moment, the GIW suddenly activated, and the familiar voice of
the service bot Kevin said, "Poor alien, your body is imprisoned and
will be subjected to intense squeezing and friction. We suggest you try
to fall asleep to reduce the pain."</p>
<p>Kevin also provided a visual feed, showing how I was being sucked
into the womans body. I saw her eyes closed and her mouth wide open,
clearly in a state of euphoria. It became evident that she was
deliberately using her lower bodys muscles to squeeze me for her own
pleasure.</p>
<p>Many strange women in the Guoker System shared this trait.</p>
<p>The pressure from her squeezing was immense and unbearable. Gathering
all my strength, I twisted my body 90 degrees and managed to slip
entirely inside, feeling immediate relief. The inside of her lower body
was the same dark purple-red color as her mouth, with blue spots
flickering. A fleshy curtain started closing slowly, and I panicked,
fearing suffocation. Luckily, it stopped before fully closing. I found
myself in a narrow gap between two layers of flesh, with a large
intestine-like tube filling my mouth and numerous tendrils wrapping
around my face, emitting an awful stench. But I could still breathe, and
the internal suction had ceased, which made me feel somewhat relaxed, as
the foul smell was preferable to suffocation.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the giant woman had only temporarily pulled me
into her body and would release me after satisfying her whims, at least
allowing me to urinate and defecate. However, I was mistaken. She kept
me inside and began experimenting with different tortures.</p>
<p>Soon, a thick tendril violently penetrated my anus, growing inside
me. With her body tightly encasing mine, I couldnt see what was
happening and was unable to move. I tried using my mind to resist, but
it was futile. I could only feel the thick tendril brutally writhing and
squeezing through my insides.</p>
<p>It started with one tendril but soon felt like many. They invaded my
large intestine, small intestine, urethra, stomach, and finally reached
my throat and mouth. I opened my mouth, and a purple-red tendril
emerged, horrifying me. At that moment, her flesh began rhythmically
contracting, tightening around my body. The tendril inside my urethra
pulsed rhythmically, giving me an intense, unprecedented pleasure that
lasted a long time.</p>
<p>Periods of sleepiness washed over me intermittently. Unlike before,
where pleasure would disappear upon waking, this time, the extreme
pleasure remained even when I woke up. Throughout my dreams, the
pleasure persisted, seemingly originating from the tendrils filling and
pressing against my rectum and urethra. I drifted in and out of
consciousness, experiencing various hallucinations and an overwhelming
sense of satisfaction, feeling like days or perhaps longer had
passed.</p>
<p>Only then did I remember what Norton said: when a giant female
parasitic species absorbs you into her body and engages in intercourse
with you, the pleasure level is 10, compared to just 1 with a normal
human. However, Norton also mentioned that the pain these giant
parasitic species can inflict is the greatest and lasts the longest.
This thought brought back a wave of horror and worry.</p>
<p>I speculated that this unprecedented pleasure might be due to being
fully absorbed into her body, allowing for maximum physical contact.
Additionally, her internal tendrils penetrating my body might have
injected some kind of toxin, creating these wonderful hallucinations. I
hadnt anticipated that she would take over my bodily functions,
supplying nutrients and oxygen while removing waste through her
tendrils. My assumption that I would need to be let out daily to urinate
and defecate was completely wrong.</p>
<p>I was suspended upside down, tightly encased in her body,
occasionally glimpsing the outside world through a small gap. My body
was ruthlessly penetrated by her tendrils, and I was powerless to
resist. All my previous positive assumptions about these so-called
civilized and intelligent amphibious beings vanished. They seemed even
more barbaric and cruel. I anticipated they had more tortures in store
for me.</p>
<p>After some time, a strong squeezing force expelled me from her body.
I felt a surge of hope, thinking she might release me. Instead, she held
my back and thrust my head into another giants body, pushing and pulling
me back and forth in a sawing motion, forcefully squeezing and rubbing
my body. Despite my exhaustion, they showed no sign of stopping. The GIW
showed me video footage of them in high spirits, thoroughly enjoying
themselves.</p>
<p>Realizing that resistance was futile due to their immense strength, I
decided to try and fall asleep to escape the torment. However, the
intense friction and squeezing made it difficult. Exhaustion led to
hallucinations, and I felt close to death. Eventually, they stopped
before I died, and I fell asleep inside her body.</p>
<p>I had no idea how long I had slept, but I dreamed of being free from
her body, basking in the sun in her arms, feeling incredibly
comfortable, joyful, peaceful, and happy. A sudden, strong movement woke
me up, and I realized I was still inside her body. She had jumped into
the water from a height, and the icy water hitting my face woke me. The
light quickly disappeared, replaced by darkness as she closed her flesh
curtain, likely because she was swimming.</p>
<p>The GIW provided information showing her swimming with three other
giant women, all naked, in the sea. Her belly was noticeably larger than
those who had no one inside them. Despite their size, they swam
gracefully and elegantly.</p>
<p>Being upside down for so long, the blood rushed to my head, causing
severe dizziness and tinnitus. The discomfort was intense, and I
desperately wanted to escape from her body. Unable to do so, I forced
myself to sleep to alleviate the suffering and anxiety. Hallucinations
and strange memories flooded my mind. I felt like I had been with her
for a very long time, often in a state of semi-consciousness, as if I
had spent years living inside her body under the sea. Could this be
memories of a past life on some other planets ocean?</p>
<p>During this time, I dreamed frequently. In one recurring dream, I was
in a giant, sticky oil tank with an extremely slippery tendril passing
through my mouth and out my anus, connecting the sky and the ground. My
body slowly slid along this tendril, experiencing immense pleasure as it
rubbed against my intestines, stomach, and throat. Another common dream
was I swam in a special ocean where the water seemed to be thick,
transparent oil. No matter how hard I try to swim upward, I couldn’t see
the sea level and had to swim horizontally.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I encountered tightly intertwined snake-like creatures
resembling a hybrid of snakes, eels, octopuses, and women. These beings
would immediately wrap around me, with some coiling around my legs,
neck, or abdomen, and others penetrating my mouth and anus, only to exit
and re-enter repeatedly. This interaction gave me extreme pleasure and a
silky smooth sensation, devoid of any fear or pain.</p>
<p>Aside from sleeping inside her, I only imagined being able to leave
her body and move freely. But she never let me out. I dreamt countless
times of escaping, feeling elated in the dream. However, upon waking, I
would see the same familiar sliver of light between the meat curtains,
with my mouth and nostrils filled with her flesh tubes. My mood would
immediately shift from happiness to deep disappointment and despair.</p>
<p>It might have been the prolonged inversion, or perhaps she replaced
my blood or injected something toxic into me. Whatever the cause,
everything I saw turned a distorted mix of red and yellow hues, and my
vision became blurred.</p>
<p>Finally, there was one instance when she actually let me out. She lay
on a virtual sofa with her eyes closed and placed me on her legs. The
surroundings were bathed in brilliant sunlight, and the scenery was
breathtakingly beautiful, yet too dazzling for my eyes, likely because I
had been in darkness for so long. I tried to slide down her legs and
escape, but I couldnt stand up, no matter how hard I tried. It felt as
if my body was broken into pieces, unable to coordinate. I silently
cursed my own uselessness, lamenting how I could squander this rare
chance to escape by not being able to walk.</p>
<p>Soon, I discovered that I could still crawl. I attempted to crawl
away, but not far along, I felt a tug from a flesh tube still connecting
my anus to her body. A slight pull caused excruciating pain in my
internal organs, leaving me no choice but to return dejectedly. Since
she had captured me, I had never truly been able to escape her body;
even moments like this, basking in sunlight, were exceedingly rare.
Norton and Willie were right—these amphibious women are incredibly
greedy, domineering, and cruel. Once they capture a man, they absorb him
into their body and lock him in permanently.</p>
<p>Initially, I eagerly anticipated her letting me out, but later, I
became utterly terrified of it. Whenever she exerted pressure to expel
me, my heart filled with intense fear. Most of the time, her purpose in
releasing me was for the amusement of the three giant women. She often
squeezed me out, making my upper body protrude from her. Those three
giants would then gather around, spitting on me and spraying me with
foul, viscous liquid from their groin tubes. After the sticky liquid ran
out, one of them would absorb my upper body into her own. Since a flesh
tube connected me to another giant woman, providing oxygen, they knew I
wouldn’t suffocate no matter who swallowed me. They might also have used
some external circulation system to infuse oxygenated blood into my
body.</p>
<p>Once my upper body was absorbed into another giant, I endured
repeated rubbing and squeezing. Sometimes, the other two giants would
extend their flesh tubes inside, wrapping them tightly around my
abdomen, applying immense pressure. Another flesh tube would then invade
my anus, already occupied by one, causing intense constriction and
squeezing sensations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when these foreign flesh tubes penetrate my urethra, they
immediately expand, and other flesh tubes quickly wrap around my penis,
squeezing it tightly. This internal and external pressure causes me
extreme pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I feel like they torture me for hours without extracting
my upper body. They seem to enjoy this squeezing and rubbing, which
might give them pleasure, but I can hardly bear it. Each time, I feel on
the verge of death. I often shout at these giant women, but they either
dont understand or completely ignore me. I never get a response from
them.</p>
<p>In my heart, I silently plead: "I cant take it anymore, please let me
go!" I hope Kevin could relay this message to the giants, but it has no
effect. At those times, I worry about whether I will be able to walk if
I ever get out of their bodies. This is a serious concern. I suspect
that the last time I emerged from her body and couldnt walk was due to
her flesh tubes affecting my internal organs. These tubes inside me made
it impossible to stand, much like a loach with a straight wire inserted
in its body, preventing it from bending.</p>
<p>I not only hope to escape from this giant womans body but also wish
that her flesh tubes will completely withdraw from mine, so I can see if
I can stand again. If I still cant stand, I think, then I am a cripple,
unable to work back home and needing my family to take care of me. But
who will take care of me? My parents have to work on the farm, and my
grandparents, though they could care for me, are old. If it comes to
that, whats the difference between that and death? It would be better to
continue living inside her body.</p>
<p>Finally, an opportunity arose. She released me and pulled several
dark red, gooey flesh tubes from my body. Thick mucus, pale yellow and
glistening, flowed out and pooled on the ground. I saw the tube
extracted from my anus was very thick, while the one from my urethra was
thin but very long, seemingly one or two meters in length.</p>
<p>So long? I looked in astonishment, no wonder my bladder and urethra
felt so completely filled.</p>
<p>Now that these flesh tubes have been removed from my body, it
ironically leaves me with a sense of loss, as if a part of me has been
taken away. Perhaps my consciousness had adapted to the presence of
these tubes filling my body.</p>
<p>Despite all my efforts, I still couldnt stand up, and a sense of
despair overwhelmed me. Just as I was about to collapse, another naked
giant woman approached and supported me. As she held me, her groin meat
pipes lifted into the air and sprayed sticky liquid at me. I guessed
this giant woman also wanted to swallow me; they were merely exchanging
turns, not actually letting me go. I gritted my teeth, bracing myself
for the intense pain of being sucked, rubbed, and squeezed.</p>
<p>As expected, she wanted to swallow me, but in a different way. She
used the meat pipe that sprayed sticky liquid to enter my anus first,
then extended another meat pipe into my mouth. Other giants came and
used their groin meat pipes to hold my body, preventing me from falling.
One of the giant women repeatedly massaged my penis with her meat pipe.
My penis became erect, I felt strength in it and in my arms, but why
couldnt my legs stand?</p>
<p>This weakness in my legs felt entirely different from the weakness
caused by illness. When sick, the whole body feels weak, but in this
case, my body parts seemed unable to coordinate with each other. I
wondered if they would let me go if my penis became useless now. These
giant women might not be interested in the penis of Earth men; they
might be interested in our entire bodies.</p>
<p>One of her meat pipes made its way from my mouth to my stomach and
into the intestine, pouring lots of sticky liquid, and finally exited
through my anus. Then it explored between my legs. At last, it touched
my penis, immediately wrapped around it, and extended into the urethra.
This time, because the giant woman had filled my stomach and intestines
with sticky liquid in advance, the meat pipe entering through my anus
easily slipped through my intestines and stomach into my mouth. I could
feel it branching out and probing into various parts of my body.</p>
<p>At this point, the giant woman started retracting her meat pipes,
drawing me towards her. She spread her legs and, without using her
hands, directly sucked my body into her groin. This time, my head went
in first, followed by my feet. Once inside, I felt no difficulty
breathing.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they would release my entire body. Four of them would each
extend a thick main meat pipe from their groins, attaching to my limbs
and gradually swallowing me until they stopped at my armpits and thighs.
Then they would tighten fiercely. If my head was caught in this grip,
the squeezing was excruciating. I would shout at them, but it never had
any effort.</p>
<p>Those giant women swapped me multiple times like this. Eventually,
with the help of Nortons team, I managed to escape from their
bodies.</p>
<p>When I first got out, the colors of the scenery outside seemed more
normal, but I still couldnt walk. My body felt like it was in pieces,
unable to coordinate. I was very anxious. After struggling for a while,
I could barely stand. Norton reassured me that it was okay and that I
would fully recover. I thought he was just comforting me, so I said that
if I could walk again, I would be satisfied. However, Nortons team soon
healed me completely, without any complications. I felt strong and full
of energy again, and my anxiety disappeared.</p>
<p>Some time later, Norton asked if I had noticed any changes in my
body. I said no. He then asked about any smells. That’s when I realized
I still had the distinctive stench of those giant amphibious women on my
body and in my mouth. My entire body felt like it had been soaked in
oil; my skin was smoother, and even inside my body—my intestines,
stomach, throat, esophagus, and urethra—it all felt oily. Passing stool
was very easy.</p>
<p>I later experienced tinnitus for many years, and I wonder if it
started from that time.</p>
<p>Regarding the strange dreams I had, Norton explained that the Guoker
people were very familiar with dream control techniques. That giant
woman had deliberately made me dream like that.</p>
<p>Norton explained, "Our primary method of controlling the opposite sex
is through physical attractiveness, including beautiful body figures.
This is common on Earth as well. On Earth, people often use wealth to
control others, but this doesnt happen on Guoker Planet because all
material resources are free here. Our unique method is through scent.
Especially the women, who can emit a strong, pungent odor that, after a
while, becomes addictive and attractive to the opposite sex. Each
persons scent is unique.</p>
<p>"Another method is through toxins. Various unique species on Guoker
Planet can store different toxins in their bodies. They can either spray
or inject these toxins into others to control them, which is brutal but
extremely fast.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the GMW, people can request the GMW to move them away
instantly if they sense danger. However, a quick toxin attack can be
successful before the target can request the GMW. Sometimes, if women
are low on toxins, they can request the GMW to replenish them remotely.
Many of our species have meat tubes that can extend into the bodies of
others to control them. This method is simple but often causes great
pain.</p>
<p>"Some small parasitic species can control others by entering their
bodies completely. Larger parasitic species can swallow smaller ones to
control them. This method is also simple and brutal.</p>
<p>"Another common method is dream control. By creating various dream
scenarios, we can make a distant target enter the dream we designed,
thus controlling them through their dreams. This is a highly
sophisticated control method and happens frequently on our planet. The
women often combine multiple control methods, with dream control being
the most common in conjunction with others."</p>
<p>On Earth, dreams are beyond ones control and cannot be artificially
designed. Its also impossible to invite someone into your dream. Our GIW
relies on artificial field scanning and transmits information through a
vacuum. Our GIW frequency interception technology can remotely and
non-invasively input information directly into a human brain and also
read information from every brain globally. This technology allows us
Guokers to communicate with distant friends through a vacuum using only
our brains, without external devices. Because of this, it is possible to
control someone else through dreams.</p>
<p>While our brains can connect to the GIW, we generally set information
reception thresholds, selectively accepting incoming information to
avoid overload. If someone wants to control a member of the opposite
sex, they must first use an alluring voice to present a beautiful image
of themselves to the other person. Our frequency interception technology
can transmit not only sound but also images, which can appear as 3D
holograms or be directly implanted into the brain. It can also convey
smells, touch, and other sensory information. After a period of
interaction and mutual communication, if the other person regards you as
a close friend, it lays the foundation for dream control. Dream control
is mainly executed through the GIW, with minimal reliance on other
devices. We have a vast knowledge of these techniques on Guoker.
However, this dream control of the opposite sex can often fail;
sometimes it lasts only a short while, and sometimes it even backfires,
causing the other person to control your dreams.</p>
<p>When someone else controls your dreams, you may suffer mental torture
in the dream, or sometimes you might feel pleasure; it varies.
Therefore, being controlled is not always terrifying. The real threat is
the giant parasitic species. They absorb ordinary people into their
bodies, keeping them in a constant dream state. These parasitic species
use dream control to dominate ordinary people for extended periods,
making it extremely difficult for the victims to escape their
control.</p>
<p>When the parasitic species excessively torture the person they have
absorbed, making them suffer too much, our GIW assesses the situation.
If necessary, it will end the life of the person inside the parasitic
species and transfer their consciousness into a new body. If the giant
parasitic species do not want their host to die, they must improve their
dream control skills. In our Guoker system, these giant parasitic
species are the most proficient in dream control.</p>
<p>Norton also reminded me to check if the giant woman had left anything
inside my body, but I didnt pay much attention at the time.</p>
<p>One night, I dreamed that I was back in my hometown, doing my old job
of catching ricefield eels. I saw a finely built culvert, like a plastic
pipeline, with many eels inside. I crawled in and caught a lot of them.
My bag was full, so I took off my clothes to use them as a container.
Suddenly, the eels transformed into very thin, beautiful women,
resembling the snake people I had encountered in the ocean. Their bodies
were a combination of eel, eel-like fish, and woman. They wrapped around
my body, constricting my arms, legs, and neck. I felt scared and
nervous, regretting taking off my clothes. I shouted, "What are you
trying to do?" I wondered if they were going to enter my body like the
ocean snake people did. I then had a vivid sensation of something
entering my anus, which immediately woke me up. I found myself lying on
a virtual bed in a finely decorated room, with no sign of the culvert or
the eels. However, I still felt something moving inside my anus and
abdomen. I spread my legs and used my mind to slowly push it out. To my
horror, a very thin snake woman emerged from my anus, with red, green,
and black ring patterns, resembling a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>When did I go to that culvert in my dream and get parasitized by this
snake woman? Or did she enter my body right here in this room while I
slept?</p>
<p>Later, I frequently encountered parasitic beings. Many times, small
parasitic women infiltrated my body, and on several occasions, huge
giant women swallowed me whole. There were instances when, after exiting
the giant womens bodies, I was shocked to find leech-like creatures
inside my urethra, still alive.</p>
<p>Norton explained that these were left inside my body by the giant
women.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I even saw live, fleshy tubes resembling chicken
intestines, snakes, or octopuses emerging from my mouth or anus.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-37---purple-mud-world">Chapter 37 - Purple Mud
World</h2>
<p>One time, Norton told us that we were going to visit an underground
mud world.</p>
<p>Norton brought Willie, Suldair, and me along, and we traveled through
GMW to a place with no buildings, but with many trees, grasslands, and
swamps. I guessed we were still on the Guoker Planet because if we were
going to another planet, we would have taken a flying saucer.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/nFD8wZ4Bc3f9LUa.jpg" width="163" height="228"></p>
<p>Figure: Tall trees and grass with large leaves</p>
<p>We didnt land directly on the ground; instead, we hovered in the air,
moving forward in a standing cruising position. It seemed that Norton
was looking for a suitable place to land. The trees on the ground were
of a single species, with broad leaves marked by many parallel stripes,
all in a vivid yellow-green without any dead leaves. The grass had
mostly large, round leaves, all brightly colored, with no dead leaves or
fine, pointed grass blades in sight.</p>
<p>The ground was crisscrossed with many dirt paths shaped like the
ridges of rice fields, forming circles around patches of swamp. The
swamps were a deep purple color and were densely covered with numerous
small holes. These holes had a diameter of about 50 centimeters, and
around each hole, there was a ring of light purple mud.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/gqklTHxQaj8dz9y.png" width="413" height="400"></p>
<p>Norton and Willie jumped straight into the mud holes from the air. As
they touched the mud, their virtual clothes vanished, and they
disappeared into the mud in an instant. I didnt dare to jump in, fearing
suffocation. Instead, I landed on the ridge surrounding the swamp and
walked along it. I tested the purple mud with my foot and found it felt
like the mud on Earth. I hesitated, wondering if I should jump in.</p>
<p>At this moment, Kevin told me it was safe to jump in as GMW would
automatically provide oxygen to my body. Reassured, I jumped into the
hole. The mud was very fine and smooth, with no sand or small stones
scraping my body, and it was about the same temperature as my body.
Feeling safe, I increased my sliding speed.</p>
<p>The mud holes were sloped, and I eventually slid into a large cavern.
There was light inside, and everything had a light purple hue. I looked
up and saw the hole I had come through directly above me, with lots of
slimy mud hanging around the entrance. On Earth, this mud would surely
drip down, but it seemed the Guoker GMW controlled it to prevent
that.</p>
<p>The cavern was relatively flat, about 3-4 meters high and 5-6 meters
wide, stretching endlessly in both directions. I wanted to walk, but the
floor was uneven, shaped like a wok filled with smooth, slippery mud.
Kevin suggested I lie down and slide, which worked well.</p>
<p>It seemed the GMW was assisting me, as I could effortlessly slide in
any direction I wanted, even when going uphill. I saw many side
passages, some large, some small, some on the ceiling, some on the
sides, and some below.</p>
<p>I entered one of the lower passages and found another horizontal
cavern. Kevin told me there were dozens of layers of these horizontal
passages.</p>
<p>Following Kevins guidance, I returned to the first layer. I slowly
slid through it and eventually reached a vast space. Under the faint
purple light, it revealed a strange and surreal world. Many bizarre
plants, in shades of pale green and yellow, contrasted with the light
purple background. Among these plants were various animals and many
snake-like human creatures gliding through the mud. It felt like I had
entered a bizarre alien world.</p>
<p>Kevin explained that the Guoker people could store their original
bodies in chrono fridges and switch to snake-like bodies to live in the
underground mud world permanently. These snake-like bodies made it easy
to move through the mud. Short-term visitors, however, usually did not
change bodies.</p>
<p>Indeed, I saw many Guoker people among the snake-like creatures. They
were all completely naked without any virtual clothes, but the purple
mud covering them made it less noticeable. I looked at myself and saw
that my virtual clothes had also disappeared.</p>
<p>I took a closer look at these snake people. Their bodies were slender
and elongated, similar to snakes and ricefield eels. Their waists were
extremely thin, and while they had arms, they didnt have legs—instead,
their legs were fused into tails like those of snakes and eels. Some of
them had long, thin breasts and groins, and some had hands resembling
fish tails. These snake people had human-like facial features, with
long, narrow eyes that slanted upward at a 45-degree angle. Their
eyeballs were tiny but very bright, and their mouths and noses were also
small.</p>
<p>Their bodies came in various colors: some were blood red, some bright
green, and others glistening black. Typically, their backs were darker,
and their bellies lighter. Some had colorful patterns, and all their
colors were vivid and their skin smooth and shiny. The sizes of these
snake people varied greatly.</p>
<p>I didnt dare to get close to them. Since we were all lying down and
sliding around, it was hard to see each other clearly, so no one seemed
to notice that I looked different from the usual Guoker people.</p>
<p>Despite the allure of the slick, shiny snake women, I knew how
dangerous they could be, so I kept my distance. I closed my eyes and
imagined a scenario: if I appeared in front of them, they would swarm
around me, entangling me with their flesh tubes, probing every part of
my body. First, it would feel pleasurable, but then I would become
exhausted, unable to withstand their relentless pace. If several of them
pulled their flesh tubes in different directions, it would feel like my
insides were being torn apart.</p>
<p>Without Norton and the others around, I dared not take any risks.</p>
<p>Later, I decided to enter a small tunnel to see what was happening on
the surface. While sliding through the mud tunnel, I suddenly bumped
into someone who immediately hugged or wrapped around me tightly. In the
darkness, I couldnt see, but I could tell by touch that it was a slender
woman. Her body was cool, hard, and extremely smooth, which was very
arousing. I held her waist, which was as thin as my arm. Her arms around
my waist were also thin but very strong. I caressed her waist up to her
long, hard, smooth breasts. Then I moved my hands down to her hips,
which, though small, were more stimulating than her breasts.</p>
<p>I felt her legs, which were fused together. Then I found a large
flesh cavity in her lower body that my hand easily slipped into. It felt
similar to the anatomy of ordinary Guoker women, with many small flesh
tubes inside. I wanted to have sex with her since she was alone, and I
had no reason to worry unless a group of them surrounded me. However,
she kept wriggling and twisting around me, making it impossible for my
penis to enter her. Realizing she didnt want to mate, I released her and
tried to move away.</p>
<p>But she soon entangled me again, causing my penis to become erect. I
felt anxious, not understanding her intentions. She guided me to a
larger cavern. It was cone-shaped, about three meters in diameter at its
widest point, with a ring of mud on the ground under the dim purple
light. We sat on the mud ring, embracing each other. I saw that her
entire body was red, except for a lighter red on her belly. She had many
meat tubes on her head, and her groin was already spitting out numerous
thin purple tubes. She struggled to free herself from my embrace and
climbed onto my head.</p>
<p>I realized she wanted to insert her groin tubes into my mouth. As
expected, she wrapped her body around my neck and forced all her tubes
into my mouth. Soon, I felt a pleasant sensation in my stomach and
intestines, though I worried her tubes might pierce through. Eventually,
I felt a lot of sticky liquid being ejected from my anus onto my legs,
indicating her tubes had passed through my entire digestive tract. I
touched with my hands and confirmed it was indeed her tubes, accompanied
by the sticky liquid.</p>
<p>She then rode on me, vigorously entwining her body and tubes around
me. Although it was exhausting, she was alone, and her tubes didnt
pierce my abdomen, so I continued to feel pleasure. I eventually fell
asleep. When I woke up, she was gone, and fearing she might return with
others, I quickly fled through the hole. This sexual encounter was
highly satisfying and free from pain or torment. However, I remained
cautious, avoiding any interaction with Guoker women due to past
traumatic experiences.</p>
<p>Later, I slid into a larger cone-shaped cavern, measuring dozens of
meters in diameter, again bathed in faint purple light. The cavern was
empty except for a large lotus-like plant in the center, glowing with a
white-cyan light. The center of the lotus resembled a seedpod,
surrounded by dozens of leaves and many thin, smooth tendrils, all
glowing with the same white-cyan light.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I approached the plant and noticed a strange,
pleasant fragrance. I wanted to sit on the lotus seedpod, imagining it
would feel like the Buddha sitting in a lotus flower. Although the
tendrils resembled the tubes of Guoker women, which made me hesitant, I
eventually decided to sit on the lotus and wait for Norton and the
others, thinking it was safer than wandering around and risking danger.
I did not realize the danger of the lotus itself. Sitting on it felt
soft and fragrant, soon making me drowsy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt a tube entering my anus, which shocked me awake. I
tried to escape, but the tube had already reached my stomach, making it
impossible to move. The lotus leaves closed in on me, and seven or eight
slender, green snake people emerged from the seedpod, surrounding me and
spraying me with a special, foul-smelling slime. They then began
wrapping around my body and penetrating me. I closed my eyes, hoping
Norton and the others would come to my rescue.</p>
<p>The snake people tightly coiled around my neck, and some began
entering my mouth. This time, thanks to the oxygen supplied by GMW, I
didnt feel suffocated or too uncomfortable. These snake people, a blend
of animal and plant life forms, continuously wound in and out of my
body. Thankfully, I did not suffer much, and eventually, Norton and his
friends managed to get me out of there.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-38---meet-a-guoker-scientific-leader">Chapter 38 - Meet
a Guoker Scientific Leader</h2>
<p>Norton suggested we visit a renowned scientist on Guoker Planet named
Liven. He is as famous on Guoker as Albert Einstein is on Earth. Liven
has played a crucial role in the scientific development of Guoker
Planet, especially in physics, mathematics, and philosophy, and he has
had a significant influence throughout the Guoker System.</p>
<p>Once, Norton arranged a meeting with Liven. Norton, Suldair, Willie,
and I traveled via the GMW to a science communications center on Guoker
Planet to meet him. We waited in a room at the center for Liven to
arrive. While we waited, Norton and the others talked about Liven, and
it was clear they held him in high esteem.</p>
<p>Norton said, "On our Guoker Planet, or even in the entire Guoker
System, the destiny of our people is in the hands of great scientists
like Liven. The GMW and the GIW have brought tremendous convenience to
our lives, but they have also made us highly dependent on these
networks. We cannot live without them. The Guoker people are essentially
governed by science, and in that sense, by leaders like Liven. Through
him, we can access more of the planets resources."</p>
<p>Norton added, "I have spoken with Liven before on the GIW, but I
never had the chance to meet him in person. It was only after I sent him
Brother Qians information that he agreed to meet us. We owe this meeting
to Qian."</p>
<p>It was evident that Norton, Willie, and Suldair held Liven in great
admiration during their conversation. Only I seemed indifferent. Shortly
after, Liven suddenly appeared. He looked quite ordinary and was about
the same height as Norton. He had a very friendly face, but his eyebrows
were unusually thick and black, as if they were painted on, contrasting
with the typical short, narrow, and light eyebrows of the average Guoker
person, which are often barely visible.</p>
<p>Norton and his fellows stood up to welcome Liven, similar to how we
Earth humans do. Norton, Suldair, and Liven placed their right hands on
their chests and extended their left arms to lightly tap each others
shoulders. This seemed to be their greeting etiquette. Liven did not
display any arrogance typical of a great scientist and soon engaged in a
lively conversation with Norton and the others.</p>
<p>Norton and Suldair appeared to have many topics they wanted to
discuss with Liven. However, today, Livens interest was entirely focused
on me. He asked Norton, "What is the purpose of bringing Qian to Guoker
Planet?"</p>
<p>Norton replied, "When Brother Qian was a boy, he encountered some
highly advanced aliens in the farmland outside his house. These aliens
might be millions or even billions of years more advanced than us.
During their contact, these highly advanced aliens invaded Qians brain.
Qian has some of their memories. We have already conducted experiments
on Qians brain and recorded these memories. We will analyze this data in
detail later."</p>
<p>Liven asked, "How did you know Qian encountered advanced aliens?"</p>
<p>Norton answered, "We are all members of the Earth People Research
forum on the GIW. Early on, we established a system to monitor Earth
people. Whenever other aliens make contact with Earth, our equipment can
quickly pick up the information and automatically track and record
it."</p>
<p>Liven asked, "You did a nice job. Did you discover any new and deeper
understandings about the Universe from the advanced aliens consciousness
information in Qians brain?"</p>
<p>Norton replied, "We have only recorded Qians consciousness
information so far and have not yet conducted a detailed analysis. We
plan to do this next, and with luck, we might find a lot of valuable
information."</p>
<p>Suldair then turned to me and suggested, "Now is your chance to ask
Liven about the mysteries of the Universe."</p>
<p>I asked, "How did the Universe come into being?"</p>
<p>Liven replied, "The question itself is flawed. The Universe has
always existed; it has no beginning and no end. The Universe has no age.
Time is merely a perception created by the speed of light spreading out
in space around people. Without people, there would be no concept of
time or sequence."</p>
<p>Suldair added, "Your scientists on Earth believe that the Universe
was born from a big bang 15 billion years ago. This view is incorrect.
In parts of the Universe, stars attract each other and shrink into
high-density bodies. Eventually, they collide with other stars, creating
massive explosions that form nebulae, which then evolve into galaxies.
This cycle of evolution happens repeatedly in different parts of the
Universe. The big bang theory only applies to specific regions of the
Universe. It is completely wrong to say that the entire Universe
originated from a single big bang."</p>
<p>I asked, "What is the most profound secret of the Universe? Can it be
explained in one sentence?"</p>
<p>Suldair clarified my question, "He is asking about the ultimate
theorem of the Universe, the highest rule."</p>
<p>Liven answered, "In my opinion, the Universe is constituted by matter
and the space surrounding it. Nothing else exists. There is no third
entity coexisting with these. Everything else is merely our description
of the movement of matter and the surrounding space. This is the
fundamental law of the Universe, the most profound and supreme law.
Nothing is more advanced than this. This is also the deepest
understanding of any civilization in the Universe. No matter how
advanced they are, their understanding does not surpass this. On all
civilized planets, the first person to comprehend this can be considered
godlike. Its worth mentioning that one of the most famous scientists on
your Earth has recognized this fundamental cosmic law."</p>
<p>I said, "Albert Einstein? He is the most famous scientist on
Earth."</p>
<p>"Not Einstein, but Galileo Galilei. Galileo once said, The presence
of the physical world experienced by our senses is an illusion; the
geometric world behind it is the reality. The geometric world is
composed of matter and space. Galileos statement indicates that he
understood only matter and space truly exist in the Universe, while
physics is merely our description of their movement. Without human
perception, the physical world would not exist, but the geometric world
would continue to exist.</p>
<p>"The Universe has two aspects: the one we see and the true one behind
it. The visible Universe is complex, but its existence is an illusion
created by our descriptions of matter and space movement. The true
Universe is simple, composed only of matter and space. Colors, sounds,
and heat that you perceive are all descriptions formed by your mind.
Without humans, these perceptions would not exist."</p>
<p>"On other civilized planets, it is only when science has developed to
a certain level that people can realize the fundamental cosmic laws
mentioned above. However, Galileo on your Earth was an exception. How
could he have made such a statement when science on Earth was still
underdeveloped? It is said that physics on Earth began with Galileo.
When you Earthlings truly understand that the existence of the physical
world is an illusion, as Galileo said, you may be amazed that physics
begins and ends with Galileo.</p>
<p>"The highest law of the Universe falls within the realm of physics,
which is the study of movement. Once you understand the highest law of
the Universe, the depth of physics reaches its limit. However,
mathematics is different. Mathematics has no highest law, and as we have
discovered, the understanding of mathematics has no end."</p>
<p>Liven continued, "Unless he was inspired by a superior alien
civilization, I would think Galileo was a god in the Universe to have
such a profound understanding."</p>
<p>Suldair laughed, "We are planning to make Qian a god like that. We
intend to use field scanning technology to infuse certain fundamental
scientific theories into his brain, especially those related to time,
space, and the essence of the field. Brother Qian will be the god of
Earth, and we will be the creators of this god. Haha!"</p>
<p>Liven interjected, "How will you get past the Galactic Agreement
Alliance (GAA)? The GAA requires that all memories related to technology
be erased when someone from a less advanced civilization returns after
visiting an advanced civilization, especially those memories related to
time, space, and the essence of the field. On all inhabited and
civilized planets, deciphering the essence of the field is a turning
point. It means that technologies such as artificial field scanning,
teleportation through GMW, light-speed flying saucers, free energy,
healing through artificial information fields, and mind scanning for
immortality will soon be realized. While these technologies can
significantly improve the quality of life, they can also instantly kill
everyone on the planet.</p>
<p>"For example, teleportation technology generated by an artificial
field could be programmed to remove peoples heads. Once the artificial
field is activated, everyones heads would be severed from their bodies.
On some planets, peoples moral development lags behind their
technological advancement, making such scenarios highly possible. The
GAAs regulations are reasonable for those civilizations where people are
prone to violence."</p>
<p>Norton responded confidently, "We have conducted extensive research
and have found ways to circumvent the GAAs checks. We are determined to
help Qian bring advanced field-related technologies to Earth, making him
the Liven of Earth."</p>
<p>Liven laughed heartily, "Haha! If Earthlings master the secret of the
field, they will enter a virtual era where invisible forces are at work
everywhere, an era of light-speed travel, and an era of galactic
civilization. And it will be thanks to you, Norton, Suldair, and Willie!
You certainly have grand ambitions!"</p>
<p>Willie said, "If Qian becomes famous on Earth, Ill come visit you in
a flying saucer."</p>
<p>I asked, "What if Im unknown? You wouldnt come?"</p>
<p>She replied, "Im not sure. Maybe I would still come."</p>
<p>Liven asked, "Even if you infuse field-related scientific theories
into Qians brain through field scanning technology, are you confident
that Qian will be able to understand this knowledge and spread it on
Earth? Is Qian capable of doing this?"</p>
<p>"A great scientist needs three characteristics: intelligence, wisdom,
and integrity. Intelligence and wisdom are different. Intelligence is
the speed at which one accepts, understands, and expresses knowledge.
Wisdom is the ability to process, utilize, conclude, upgrade, and
innovate upon the knowledge acquired. Wisdom is obviously more important
than intelligence. Integrity is also crucial, as it ensures one remains
committed to the truth. Intelligence and wisdom only ensure one can
discover and comprehend the truth, while integrity allows one to persist
in the pursuit of truth."</p>
<p>Norton replied, "We have monitored Qian for a long time. He possesses
these three characteristics."</p>
<p>I said, "I recall reading in an Earth magazine that the core secret
of nature is hidden in time. If humans decipher the essence of time,
they will understand the core secret of the Universe. But you mentioned
that the secret of the Universe is hidden in the essence of the field. I
dont quite understand."</p>
<p>Liven answered, "The core secret of the Universe actually lies in
space. The essence of the field is space moving in a cylindrical,
helical manner. So, it can be said that the core secret of the Universe
is hidden in the field. Any object in the Universe, including our bodies
as observers, has a surrounding space that moves at the speed of light,
radiating outward from the object as the center. This movement of space
gives us, as observers, the perception of time. Time, field, mass,
electric charge, speed, force, momentum, energy, heat, sound,
color—these are all properties described by us observers about the
movement of the object and the surrounding space itself."</p>
<p>Liven continued, "The core secret of the Universe is hidden in space,
specifically in the movement of space itself. Recognizing that space
itself is in motion is the key."</p>
<p>I asked, "But why do objects in the Universe move? Is it due to the
influence of force? What exactly is force?"</p>
<p>Liven replied, "The movement of all matter in the Universe is caused
by the movement of space itself. Force can be seen as the degree of
change in the movement state of matter and space."</p>
<p>I asked again, "So, the movement of matter is caused by the movement
of space. But why does space move?"</p>
<p>Liven said, "Physics is merely our description of the geometric
world. Thus, any physical state always has a corresponding geometric
state. In geometry, a three-dimensional vertical state means that from
any point in space, we can draw three mutually perpendicular lines. When
we analyze, calculate, and describe this in our brains, it becomes a
physical state of motion. Any object in a three-dimensional vertical
state must have relative motion with respect to us as observers, and its
constantly changing direction and trajectory can reconstruct a new
vertical state. This is the underlying reason for the movement of matter
and space. Force is the degree of change in the movement state of matter
and space. Using force to explain why matter and space move indicates a
lack of deeper understanding. The essence of motion is our description
of the vertical state of space. Without us as observers, there is no
state of motion or rest. Therefore, discussing motion or rest is
meaningless."</p>
<p>I responded awkwardly, "I dont quite understand what youre
saying."</p>
<p>Suldair said, "Its normal not to understand. This explanation
addresses one of the core secrets of the Universe: why everything in
space moves."</p>
<p>I asked, "I read in a book that 3D space means that from any point in
space, you can draw three straight lines perpendicular to each other. So
why is space three-dimensional?"</p>
<p>Liven continued, "In the Universe, from the smallest electrons and
protons to the largest bodies like Earth, Moon, Sun, and the Milky Way
Galaxy, all objects move in a spiral form within space. Space itself
also moves in a cylindrical spiral form. This is why we experience space
as three-dimensional.</p>
<p>"Relative to us observers, space is always moving in a cylindrical
spiral form. A straight-line movement constitutes one-dimensional space.
Rotational movement on a plane constitutes two-dimensional space. When
this rotational movement also moves perpendicularly to the plane, it
forms a cylindrical spiral, resulting in three-dimensional space. Our
space is a right-hand spiral space. Imagine holding your right hand
around the spiral space: your fingers follow the spiral direction, and
your thumb points in the direction of the straight-line movement. This
describes the cylindrical spiral movement, a combination of rotation and
perpendicular straight-line movement."</p>
<p>I asked, "Is there such a thing as left-hand spiral space?"</p>
<p>Liven answered, "It doesnt naturally exist, but it can be
artificially created. If there were left-hand spiral space, where space
moves in a left-hand direction around matter, it would be repelled by
the right-hand spiral space surrounding normal matter. Over billions of
years of cosmic evolution, these left-hand spiral spaces would have been
pushed to the farthest edges of the Universe. Even if they exist, we
wouldnt be able to detect them."</p>
<p>Suldair added, "Regarding movement, your Earth scientists have yet to
recognize that the description of movement in physics cannot be
separated from us as observers. It is we who describe the state of
movement. We continuously affirm and deny the position of an object in
space, leading to our understanding of its motion."</p>
<p>Liven supplemented, "We, as observers, describe both the state of
motion and the state of rest. Without observers, or without specifying
any observers, neither state can be determined, making the concepts of
motion and rest meaningless."</p>
<p>Suldair said, "Concepts like mass, electric charge, field, force,
momentum, and energy are also crucial for understanding the essence of
the Universe.</p>
<p>"Mass is the number of spatial displacements at the speed of light
around an object.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>"Positive charge is the number of spatial displacements radiating
outwards at the speed of light from an object within a unit of time.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>"</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/zfqoBscVnKQCRmP.png" width="268" height="333"></p>
<p>Negative charge is the number of spatial displacements converging
towards the negative charge from infinitely far away in space at the
speed of light within a unit of time.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/L8B47PvJkMfznxI.png" width="269" height="325"></p>
<p>"Positive and negative charges both have their surrounding space
moving in a cylindrical spiral form, and both follow a right-hand spiral
pattern. The difference is that positive charge has space that diverges
outward, while negative charge has space that converges inward.</p>
<p>"Energy also reflects the state of movement of matter in space and
the movement of the space around matter."</p>
<p>Liven continued his explanation, "You Earth people think of momentum
as mass multiplied by velocity. However, on Guoker Planet, our concept
of momentum is mass multiplied by the vector speed of light minus the
objects movement speed. The reason we include the vector speed of light
in our equation is that you Earth people do not realize that when an
object is stationary, the surrounding space is always radiating outward
at the speed of light.</p>
<p>"If we take the derivative of this momentum equation with respect to
time, we derive four types of forces. First, mass changing over time
multiplied by the vector speed of light, which is the electric field
force. Second, mass changing over time multiplied by the objects
velocity, which is the magnetic field force. Third, the vector speed of
light changing over time multiplied by mass, which is the nuclear force.
Fourth, velocity changing over time multiplied by mass, which is
gravity, also known as the inertial force in Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<p>"These are the four forces that your Earth scientist Albert Einstein
sought to unify in a single grand equation. He spent decades trying, but
he never succeeded."</p>
<p>Suldair added, "Your scientists still dont understand the true nature
of light. They dont know what a photon is. A photon is created when a
negative charge accelerates, generating a counter-gravity field, causing
some electrons to lose their mass and charge, turning into an excited
state and moving at the speed of light. The particle nature of the
photon comes from the excited electron, while the wave nature comes from
the inherent wave movement of space itself. Space is always undulating,
and this wave motion occurs at the speed of light. The photon is
stationary in space but moves with the space itself."</p>
<p>Liven continued, "There are two models for a photon. One is an
excited electron moving in a cylindrical spiral form, with the
straight-line component moving at the speed of light. The other involves
two excited electrons orbiting symmetrically around a straight line,
moving at the speed of light in the direction perpendicular to the plane
of rotation."</p>
<p>Norton asked me, "Do you understand what Liven just explained?"</p>
<p>I replied, "I understand parts of it, and I have noted everything
down. I might understand more of it later."</p>
<p>Norton said, "We will use artificial field scanning technology to
embed all this knowledge into your brain. When you need to use this
knowledge, it will naturally come to you. Our design ensures that this
knowledge will not overwhelm your brain by appearing all at once. You
will gradually master these concepts through use. This knowledge will be
very important to you Earth people."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-39---guoker-scientist-on-consciousness-soul-and-reincarnation">Chapter
39 - Guoker Scientist on Consciousness, Soul and Reincarnation</h2>
<p>I suddenly recalled a question that has always concerned me: "Do we
Earth people have nothing left after death? Is reincarnation real?"</p>
<p>Norton replied, "For all humans on Earth and elsewhere in the
universe, death is not the end. Reincarnation on Earth is real, and the
cycle of life is genuine on many planets in the universe. Humans can be
divided into two parts: the body and consciousness. Consciousness is the
movement of charged particles in the brain, essentially information that
can be quantified.</p>
<p>"Its absurd to think about the mass, volume, or energy of
consciousness.</p>
<p>"The body can die and decay, but the core of a person, their
consciousness, is a form of information that doesnt die or decay. It can
reappear in the universe repeatedly. The universes core principle is to
endlessly and infinitely manifest all forms of movement, possibilities,
and information. This is why the reincarnation of life for Earth people
is real, and the reason is simple.</p>
<p>"From birth to death on Earth, you are only experiencing a segment of
countless life cycles. Some of you might vaguely realize this when
approaching death. Reincarnation is endless, with past and future lives,
endlessly recurring on Earth.</p>
<p>"Reincarnation is not unique to a few individuals. Animals on Earth
and people on other habitable planets also undergo reincarnation unless
they have access to immortality technologies, similar to the situation
on Earth."</p>
<p>Willie asked, "Brother Qian, do you know what your past or future
lives are?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea," I replied.</p>
<p>"Then what is the soul?" I asked again.</p>
<p>Norton explained, "Most Earth peoples consciousness is similar, but
about one-fifth is unique. The soul is part of consciousness, the core
one-fifth that distinguishes one person from another. The body is
secondary, merely a vessel for the soul.</p>
<p>"The charged particles in the human brain can disturb the surrounding
space, creating waves that carry consciousness information. These waves
spread at the speed of light." As Liven spoke, he waved his hand, and a
3D hologram appeared, showing a human head surrounded by light-like
waves dispersing outward. Liven continued, "Thus, human consciousness
can be expressed and preserved in space as waves, never disappearing.
The soul, being part of consciousness, also manifests as waves in space.
The soul wave is real; it possesses wave characteristics, a crucial
feature of the soul."</p>
<p>When 3D space moves at the speed of light, the length in the
direction of movement shrinks to zero, transforming it into 2D space.
Since 2D space has zero distance to any 3D space in the universe, a
persons soul information can instantly reach any location in the
universe. Information traveling at the speed of light actually exists in
2D space.</p>
<p>Information distributed in 3D space can also be fully preserved in 2D
space. In essence, information is a form of the movement of matter, not
matter itself, nor a component of matter. Any point in the universe can
contain all the information of the universe—past, present, and future.
This is a key concept in our Cosmic Information Field Theory.</p>
<p>You have prophets on Earth who can predict the future because any
point in space contains hidden information from the past and future, and
these prophets can capture that information. Time is our perception of
the light-speed movement of space around us. Without observers, there is
no time or sequence; all the information from billions of years in the
past and future can overlap at a single point in space.</p>
<p>Space can not only store information but also transmit it.
Information transmission in space can spread a complete information
package in all directions. Receiving this information at one place is
the same as receiving it at another, meaning information transmitted
through space is identical in all directions.</p>
<p>The difference between information and matter is that information can
overlap in space, whereas matter cannot. Information differs mainly in
structure, while matter differs in volume, length, and mass.</p>
<p>The universe contains infinite information. Information is a form of
movement, and movement represents possibility. Infinite information
implies the universe contains infinite possibilities. The core principle
of the universe is to manifest all possibilities repeatedly and
infinitely. No matter how strange or unusual, everything imaginable and
unimaginable will eventually manifest in the universe, repeatedly and
infinitely. This demonstrates the infinite nature of the universe. Any
bizarre or peculiar event will inevitably occur, merely a matter of when
or how frequently.</p>
<p>I found it difficult to understand what Liven was saying.</p>
<p>I asked, "When we Earth people reincarnate, where can we go? Is
Guoker Planet a possible destination?"</p>
<p>Suldair replied, "Thats impossible. We Guoker people have achieved
immortality, so Earth people cannot reincarnate on our planet. However,
you might reincarnate on other less advanced planets."</p>
<p>I asked, "Will we become pigs, cows, horses, or sheep when we
reincarnate on Earth?"</p>
<p>Norton responded, "No, the soul forms of pigs, cows, horses, and
sheep are too different from humans."</p>
<p>I asked, "Will I become a woman if I reincarnate?"</p>
<p>Norton said, "No, the soul forms are too different, so that person
would not be you anymore."</p>
<p>I asked, "If people can reincarnate, does that mean we Earth people
dont need to fear death?"</p>
<p>Norton answered, "Death causes you Earth people to lose all your
memories, which is the most significant harm, incomparable to other
factors. The human soul is innate, like a warehouse, while memories are
acquired after birth, like goods stored in the warehouse. As memories
accumulate, its like the warehouse filling with goods. When memories are
lost, its like losing all the goods. When a person dies, the soul can be
preserved in space, but all memories are lost, just like a warehouse
being relocated with all its goods gone."</p>
<p>I asked, "Do you have any way to know my past life?"</p>
<p>Norton replied, "We can find some information about your past and
future lives. Any point in the universe contains information about the
past, present, and future, including your past and future lives. This is
the most important theorem of our Cosmic Information Field Theory.</p>
<p>"We use artificial fields to scan space and decipher information to
learn about your past and future lives. We can predict your remaining
experiences on Earth. You might wonder how we can predict your future
life, as it hasnt happened yet, unlike past lives. This is related to
the essence of time. Time is our perception of light-speed spatial
movements around us. Without observers, all information from billions of
years in the past and future can overlap at a single point in space.
Conversely, theoretically, all information at any point in the universe
can be deciphered."</p>
<p>Liven added, "However, it is very challenging in practice. We Guoker
people dedicate the most resources to deciphering hidden information in
space to predict the future, which is the most advanced scientific
research on our planet. Our top mathematicians and physicists are
involved, needing foundational knowledge in physics like Universal
Information Field Theory and various mathematical theories, primarily
trend analysis.</p>
<p>"Our trend analysis is similar to Earths calculus but broader. It
deals with situations like division by zero, analyzing how zero is
approached, leading to many mathematical branches. Trend analysis also
uses magnification and reduction for comparison to make predictions. The
main goal is to predict the future, hence the name trend analysis."</p>
<p>Suldair proudly said, "Our research on hidden information in space
can reveal not only the souls of your past and future lives but also
authentic video footage from the Tang and Song dynasties on Earth. If we
Guoker people officially contact you Earth people, we will show you
these materials so you can understand your true history.</p>
<p>"We Guoker people came to Earth in ancient times and recorded much
real footage, but it still doesnt compare to what we obtain from
deciphering hidden information in space."</p>
<p>I asked, "When will you make official contact with us Earth
people?"</p>
<p>Suldair replied, "As soon as you Earth people can build light-speed
flying saucers, we will consider making official contact.</p>
<p>"Even if we Guoker people dont make official contact, other advanced
civilizations will. They might feel that you Earth people are qualified
to communicate with them. Once you Earth people are traveling around the
universe in light-speed flying saucers, we are bound to encounter each
other. Its better to establish official contact early on to foster
understanding and communication."</p>
<h2 id="chapter-40---back-home">Chapter 40 - Back Home</h2>
<p>Finally, Norton mentioned sending me back home. My experiences on the
planet Guoker these past days were fresh and exhilarating, but now that
it was time to leave, I felt a deep sadness. What made it worse was that
they planned for Suldair and Norton to pilot the spaceship to take me
back, instead of Willie. Why wouldnt Willie take me home? Norton
explained that Willie herself chose not to. But why? Was it because she
couldnt handle the emotional strain of our parting?</p>
<p>Was I overestimating my importance? Perhaps Willie had had many
boyfriends, and losing an Earth boyfriend was inconsequential to her. Or
maybe it was just another of Nortons plans, using any excuse.</p>
<p>Norton and his team were making preparations for my departure. Norton
seemed particularly concerned about the Galactic Interstellar Alliance
(GIA), meticulously instructing me on how to avoid their scrutiny and
bring advanced technology back to Earth. However, I was indifferent to
the technology; I just missed Willie and was dissatisfied with their
arrangements, though I had no choice.</p>
<p>Norton activated a computer, and its virtual screen displayed an
image of me lying naked on a bed in a room. Someone entered the room,
dressed in a jumpsuit that covered their head, with a large black pipe
connecting the back of their neck to their hip. They held a device
resembling a microphone towards my head while monitoring a small virtual
screen.</p>
<p>Norton explained, "This is a scanner that can read some of your
brains conscious information. The GIA has ordered us to delete some of
your memories of Guoker. They will check, and if any remnants are found,
they will delete them themselves or instruct us to do so. This device
scans your head to detect any lingering memories of Guoker. Youll see
recurring images in your mind, like a black square frame with a sudden
flash of light in the center—thats deep scanning. We have ways to
counteract their scanning. Ill now show you a sequence of continuous
conscious activity in your brain."</p>
<p>Norton summoned two beautiful women. Although they were only about
one meter tall, they were very attractive, even more so than Willie.
Their faces resembled those of humans, with slim waists and no
noticeable bulges between their legs. Their skin color was similar to
that of humans, not the usual pinkish-white with greenish tints common
among Guoker people. The two women sat beside me, gently caressing my
naked body with their small hands. I felt very embarrassed with Norton
standing there, but he seemed unfazed.</p>
<p>Norton said, "These two have been specially trained to develop unique
abilities. They can hypnotize you and influence your brains conscious
information through spatial manipulation."</p>
<p>Indeed, I soon felt drowsy. In my sleep, I initially sensed the two
women beside me, but soon it felt as if I were back home on Earth, and
everything seemed very real. The two women transformed into my mother
and my wife, living harmoniously together, cooking, doing laundry,
planting vegetables, raising chickens and ducks, and doing farm work.
Meanwhile, I chopped wood, fished, and tended to the crops.
Occasionally, the scenes would disconnect and reconnect.</p>
<p>When I woke up, the two beautiful women were still sitting beside me.
Norton pointed to a virtual screen and asked if that was the dream I had
just experienced. To my astonishment, the scene on the screen was
identical to my dream.</p>
<p>"Yes, it was exactly the same as my dream. Amazing!" I replied.</p>
<p>"Good!" Norton stepped back, clenched his fists, and waved them in
triumph. "This is exactly the result I wanted."</p>
<p>Norton and the two women then left. A GIA member in a jumpsuit
entered, using a device resembling a microphone to scan my head. As
expected, I saw a black frame with a bright flash in the center in my
mind. Simultaneously, the scene of the two women transforming into my
mother and wife reappeared in my thoughts. Everything was going
smoothly. After the GIA member finished the scan and left, I was still
asleep until I heard, "Zone Map 300 Spaceship on autopilot..." I
realized I was on my way home. The return journey felt dull in
comparison to the exciting and curious adventures on Guoker. Earth’s
mundane life seemed unappealing. I chose to keep my eyes closed and
remained lying down.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard the sound of women laughing. I opened my eyes and
saw Suldair and Norton intently watching the virtual screen. The
laughter came from the two beautiful women, now kneeling by my head. My
ear translation device seemed inactive as they spoke in an unknown
language. I could only watch them with curiosity.</p>
<p>One of them made a gesture, creating a virtual barrier that separated
us from Norton’s team. My ear translation kicked back in. They said they
were helping Norton, and their reward was experiencing an Earth mans
body. They approached me, their expressions clearly showing a woman’s
desire for a man—an expression common to women from Earth, Guoker, or
the underwater inhabitants of Mercury. It was unmistakable.</p>
<p>The two women began kissing me, their virtual clothes vanishing
swiftly. Unlike typical Guoker women, they had no bulges between their
legs; instead, there was a small red dot the size of a fingertip. How
was sex supposed to happen? Disappointed, I closed my eyes, thinking it
would just be their touch.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt something like a snake moving between my legs.
Opening my eyes, I saw that pink, chopstick-thick tentacles were
emerging from their groins, crawling over my body. Soon, one tentacle
wrapped around my penis, and another entered my anus, sending waves of
intense pleasure through me. It felt like the women were snakes
entwining me, shifting me between hallucinations and clarity. I was
drenched in sweat from the exhaustion, while they seemed unaffected,
continuing to touch and laugh.</p>
<p>In my dreams, I couldn’t comprehend how I got home. When I awoke, I
was naked on my bed in my room. Sunlight was streaming through the
window. I wanted to get up, but I couldn’t find my shirt and shorts, so
I took a new set from my wardrobe.</p>
<p>Walking into the living room, I smelled the usual duck droppings. My
mother was making breakfast, and the ducks were still indoors. As I
stepped outside, everything that should have been familiar felt strange
and different, like returning home after years away. I saw a neighbor
girl and asked her what day it was. She paused her work, turned
seriously to answer me, but all she said was, "I dont know."</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Typesetter’s note: “The Journal of UFO Research” is the
only popular science magazine in China that focuses on UFOs. The
magazine was founded on February 25, 1981 by the former Gansu People’s
Publishing House (now Readers Publishing Group), and has played a great
role in promoting flying saucer research in China.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Author’s note: P = m(C-V). P is the momentum of the
object. m is the mass of the object. V is the speed of the object. C is
the vector speed of light. The direction of the vector speed of light
can change. The modulus is the scalar speed of light c, and c does not
change.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn6"><p>P_rest=m’C’, where m’ is the rest mass, which is
different from the mass m during motion. C’ is the vector speed of light
in the space around an object when it is stationary. Its direction is
different from the vector speed C of light around the object when it is
moving at a speed V, but its modulus remains the same, both are scalar
light speed c.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn10"><p>Translator’s note: It was not before the 2020s when
Zhang Xiangqian can receive digital currency on Alipay and WeChat.
Normally his income and expenditures were only by cash, because you’re
not expecting to see Chinese villagers using debit and credit cards.
