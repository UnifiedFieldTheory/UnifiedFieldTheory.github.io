<h2 id="introduction-to-zhang-xiangqians-life">Introduction to Zhang
Xiangqian’s life</h2>
<p>I, Zhang Xiangqian, am a male farmer with a junior high school
degree, born in Lujiang County, Anhui Province. I was born on August 26
(in the lunar calendar), 1967 in Xiaohuying, Wangdu Brigade, Niushou
Commune, Jinniu District, Lujiang County, Anhui Province (now renamed as
the 4th Village Group of Beiwei Village, Taichuangyuan, Lujiang County).
I have currently moved to 111 Erlongxin Street, Tongda Town, Lujiang
County, 3 kilometers away, to make a living by welding and repairing
bicycles.</p>
<p>I was born in an extremely poor family. Not only did I lack clothes
and hunger, but I also had no shoes to wear in late autumn. I had to
stand barefoot on straw, my feet froze and cracked, and they ached
deeply at night.</p>
<p>My mother almost starved to death when she was a child. My mothers
family was located in Shitou Town, near our Niushou Commune (Township<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>). Her family originally had six
people, five of whom starved to death.</p>
<p>She was adopted as a child bride (Tongyangxi<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>) in
our village at a young age. Unfortunately, the boy she would marry in
the future also starved to death. The boys family married her to my
father. My father and this deceased boy shared the same surname and
family, and had a good relationship. In addition, my father was an
extremely upright and kind man.</p>
<p>When I was very young, I fell ill once. It was too serious and I was
about to die. My mother didnt have the money to take me for treatment,
but it happened that my uncle came back from another city and met me. He
had two children who had died recently, which might have touched his
heart with compassion. He gave my mother one yuan, and my mother went to
the hospital to cure my illness.</p>
<p>At that time, the cost of treatment was very low. My mother often
told me that my life was only worth one yuan. My mother never wanted to
say why my father didnt care about me at that time. It was possible that
the father was not at home at the time.</p>
<p>I often had headaches since I was young, but I didnt know what the
problem was. At that time, my family didnt have the money to check. I
still have frequent headaches and have had many tests now, but the
doctor is unsure of the cause. When I was a child, headaches were not
just ordinary pain, but rather drowsiness, on the brink of life and
death, and I often had many hallucinations in a daze.</p>
<p>At that time, my family was extremely poor, and when I had a problem,
I never went for treatment. There was no money to go for treatment. My
mother could only let me sleep. Later on, my body was as soft as cotton,
and whenever I sweated heavily, my mother happily said, “Its better, its
better!” Sure enough, it will get better soon.</p>
<p>After growing up, my body remained conflicted. I sometimes had
headaches and weakness. I couldn’t even stand, but sometimes my energy
was particularly good. I once let out a loud roar on the dynamometer,
pulling over 295 kg, which startled the people around me.</p>
<p>When I was about seven or eight years old, there was a time when I
was alone herding geese on a sandy area, when I suddenly saw several
misty things moving rapidly in front of me, one of which suddenly
pounced on me. At that time, I felt a “buzzing” sound in my head, and I
suddenly went blind. I couldnt help but squat down. It took me a long
time to wake up, and the mist in front of me disappeared completely.</p>
<p>Before that, I didnt see a UFO either, only a red light flashed in
the western sky. It was probably between afternoon and evening, around
four or five oclock. The red light happened to appear near the sun, and
there were many red clouds near the sun at that time, so I didnt care if
there were UFOs or something like that.</p>
<p>This is the strangest thing I encountered when I was a child, and I
still remember it deeply.</p>
<p>Since around the age of twelve or thirteen, I always dreamed at
night, dreaming that I lived on another planet. On this planet, the
sunlight didnt seem very strong, and the light leaned towards blue.
There were almost no plants on this planet, and on the surface, it
seemed that it was not suitable for humans to live. People lived deeply
underground. They were riding extremely fast transportation, able to
quickly travel back and forth between the ground and underground.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing for me was that there were a large number
of extremely large and complex buildings built on this planet, above and
underground. Most of them were made of metal with a lead-gray color
tone, and the color of the entire planet was monotonous and dull.</p>
<p>Its not strange for a person to occasionally have such dreams.
However, I had been dreaming for several years, for such a long time,
and my dreams were sometimes very clear, which made me think about the
reasons behind them.</p>
<p>In addition to the encounter that happened when I herded geese, I
also encountered many strange things when I was a child. I now speculate
that it may be related to the aliens.</p>
<p>Once I had an eye disease that became increasingly severe. My family
didnt have the money to go for treatment, which dragged on for more than
half a year. The severity ranges from occasional glimpsing of light
throughout the day, to a level where I can hardly see anything and
completely blind all day.</p>
<p>I remember back then, only at four or five oclock in the afternoon
could I see a beam of light coming in from the window, shining on the
dust in the room, forming a light beam. I could only barely see this
light beam.</p>
<p>Every time at this moment, I felt a bit comforted - my eyes could
still see, and there was still hope for their healing. Until one day,
this light beam was no longer visible to me. I finally went completely
blind. I really cried until all my tears dried.</p>
<p>When my eyes couldnt open, my mother daubed them with her saliva. At
first it worked, but later it didnt work. She had no idea. She couldnt
give a penny, nor could she borrow a penny, so she couldnt take me to
the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At that time, every family was extremely poor, and people were very
ignorant and numb. Many children died, and the sadness of their family
members was not as great as the death of a kitten or puppy.</p>
<p>I ended up almost blind and totally unable to see the way. I could
only sit by the bed all day, or lie on the bed, with wild thoughts in my
mind and many illusions appearing in front of me, but I couldnt see
anything.</p>
<p>One day, while I was sleeping, I suddenly felt that the room had
become brightly red. Several people came in and packed me into a tube.
My head was tightly wrapped in a cloth bag, and my eyes seemed to have
countless small insects drilling inside.</p>
<p>Soon, my eyes unexpectedly recovered.</p>
<p>Once, I suffered from nephritis and it took me a long time to get
treatment, resulting in a serious condition. Later on, I didnt even have
the strength to lift my legs and cross the threshold. My mother asked a
barefoot doctor<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> at the doorstep, “Why does it seem
like my son A’ Qian has gained weight recently?”</p>
<p>The barefoot doctor looked at it and repeatedly scolded, “This
swelling is Yao-yan (referring to nephritis in the dialect), how can it
be gaining weight? Why are you so careless! Its too late, and your son
will probably not be saved.”</p>
<p>The doctor came to treat me, muttering under his breath, “Might as
well treat a dead horse as if its alive<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>”.
Later, in my sleep, I felt the room turn blazing red, and several people
arrived. I was put into a cylinder and felt numerous soft tubes entering
through my anus, extending throughout my entire body. Soon, my illness
was completely cured. The doctor couldnt believe it and kept exclaiming,
“How strange, how strange!”</p>
<p>When my mother saw this doctor passing by our house, he didnt even
glance back and walked straight ahead. She asked, “Why dont you give my
Ah Qian an injection?” The doctor seemed angry and said, “Your child is
cured, whats the need for an injection?”</p>
<p>We live in a remote rural area. As a child, I witnessed many people
harmed by superstitions and charlatans, and I developed a strong hatred
for these charlatans and superstitions.</p>
<p>I thought the strange people who treated me at night were gods, which
left me feeling conflicted. It wasnt until later, when I read about
aliens in a magazine, that this puzzle in my mind was solved.</p>
<p>When I was in junior high, I read about aliens and speculated that as
a child, while herding geese, I must have encountered them. At that
moment of our encounter, the consciousness and memories of one of them
might have entered my mind. Since then, Ive always had these alien
memories, which explain those bizarre dreams.</p>
<p>Ive always been just “me”, but since I can remember, or perhaps since
that odd geese-herding incident when I was seven or eight, Ive always
felt theres another “me” inside my head.</p>
<p>Ive told these strange experiences to people around me, but everyone
thought I was lying. My neighbor, a relative named Zhang Houfa, often
called me “Liar Lao San, Liar Lao San” (a local term for a notorious
liar). Later, many of my strange experiences remained untold, especially
after becoming an adult.</p>
<p>From the age of seven or eight until I was 19, I encountered aliens
several times. At the age of 19, I had an encounter where I set foot on
an alien planet and traveled for a month. After that, I never met any
aliens again, nor had any contact or strange experiences.</p>
<p>The aliens I met after I was seven or eight, I guess, were not the
same type I encountered while herding geese. The aliens I met during
geese herding might have been from a highly advanced technological
society, whereas the ones I met later seemed to have lesser
technological capabilities, possibly much lesser. Their objective might
have been connected to my experience of herding geese, possibly seeking
something from me.</p>
<p>After my experience of herding geese, my encounters with aliens
usually happened at night. I would sense their impending arrival,
thinking to myself, “They are coming, they are coming”. And soon enough,
they would appear.</p>
<p>When they came, without speaking, I could understand their
intentions. Seeing these mysterious beings, I felt no fear. They always
came at night. The first sign was the walls turning red, and they would
call me outside, passing directly through the walls.</p>
<p>When returning, they would bring me back, usually in the morning,
typically placing me back in my bed. I even doubted whether it was all a
dream.</p>
<p>Once, when they were bringing me back, I asked to be left on a
haystack in front of a cowshed in our village. The next day, I indeed
found myself sleeping on that haystack. When I returned home, my mother
had already gotten up, opened the door, and was sweeping the floor. She
didnt ask where I came from.</p>
<p>Years later, I still questioned whether my childhood experiences were
just dreams. But the incident of sleeping on the haystack, which was
undoubtedly real, convinced me that these encounters were not merely
dreams.</p>
<p>In the early summer of 1985, when I was 19, I had my last encounter
with aliens. Thereafter, I had no contact with them.</p>
<p>I was born in 1967, and according to our rural calculation, I would
be 19. I am certain it was 1985 based on many letters I wrote then,
stating I was 19 when I had my last encounter with aliens. According to
the rural age calculation, being born in 1967, it should be 1985. I
didnt look at a calendar immediately after returning from the alien
planet; I also didnt have the intention to find evidence at the
time.</p>
<p>When I was 19, the aliens took me, and I traveled on an alien planet
for a month. However, on Earth, it was only a night. Their time was
different from ours.</p>

<p>This time, as an adult who had personally visited an alien planet,
the experience left a profound impact on me. The intense shock of this
journey made me firmly believe that my multiple encounters with aliens
were real.</p>
<p>After returning from the alien planet, I was so deeply moved that I
vaguely realized the potential of alien technology to cause
earth-shattering changes on Earth. I frantically began to publicize this
matter. Over several decades, I must have written thousands of letters
to various organizations, but I only received a few responses. Most
replies were cold statements like “This matter is unrelated to us”.</p>
<p>Due to the long-term letter writing, my right middle finger became
deformed. During this period, I even applied for a patent for a new type
of fountain pen.</p>
<p>I also visited relevant organizations with my materials, but they
simply ignored my documents and explanations.</p>
<p>Some netizens suggested that these people might not accept the idea
of a farmer encountering aliens, considering it too absurd.</p>
<p>Frequently, I didnt even mention aliens. Sometimes, before I could
even speak, perhaps judged by my simple attire, they would tell me to
leave!</p>
<p>Since most of my letters went unanswered, and those few responses
stated the issue was irrelevant to them, and with no one acknowledging
my visits, my enthusiasm gradually faded.</p>
<p>I have a keen interest in physics. When I came across the concept of
magnetic fields in books, I wondered, “What exactly is a field?” The
other “me” in my head immediately answered:</p>
<p>“The essence of a field is simply a space of moving changes”. I
pondered this answer for a long time, grasping only part of its
meaning.</p>
<p>Once, I saw an introduction to Einsteins theory of relativity in a
magazine. Immediately, I had questions in my mind, “What is the true
nature of time?” The other “me” in my head told me:</p>
<p>Time is the observers perception of the speed of light moving through
the surrounding space.</p>
<p>When I first received this answer, it took me a long time to
understand why the essence of time would be described in this way. If I
were to define time-based on my own logic, I would certainly think of it
as the continuous movement of objects in the universe.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have been able to explain the nature of various
phenomena that people encounter in their lives, such as time, space,
fields, matter, light, gravity, electromagnetic forces, energy, and even
the principles behind the flight of UFOs, how prophets can predict the
future? and questions about human life, death, and the soul.</p>
<p>However, possibly due to my limited educational background,
especially in theoretical and mathematical equations, there are many
things I dont fully understand. My understanding is vague, and many of
the explanations I provide might not be clear.</p>
<p>I remember, shortly after returning from the alien planet, I had
recorded many important mathematical and physical equations given to me
by the aliens in a notebook. Once, it got wet when my brother spilled
tea on it while it was on the table. I told my brother how important the
contents of this notebook were and scolded him. He got upset and tore
the notebook to pieces when I was away. I managed to save some
fragments, but they were eventually lost too.</p>
<p>As a child, I was honest, dutiful, timid, dull, and rigid. I could
stand in one spot for half a day without moving, and I was too scared to
speak to strangers. I had difficulty speaking clearly, and my ragged
clothes, which barely covered me, often led to ridicule and scolding
from others, causing severe feelings of inferiority.</p>
<p>I was a diligent and hardworking student, but I tended to rely on
rote memorization and excessive homework. In primary school, where we
only had Chinese and Math, my grades were quite good. However, in junior
high, with more subjects to study and relying solely on hard work and
memorization, my grades were not very good due to a lack of flexibility
in thinking.</p>
<p>After failing to achieve good grades in junior high, I couldnt get
into high school. I repeated a year and tried twice to pass the high
school entrance exams, but didnt even make it through the preliminary
selection [at that time, one had to pass a preliminary round before
qualifying for the high school exams]. Consequently, I had to return
home to the farm. My father was very disappointed in me and even beat me
with a bamboo pole.</p>
<p>At 19, stimulated by my encounter with aliens, I wanted to self-study
mathematics and physics to clarify the vague ideas in my mind. I went to
the Hefei Science and Education Bookstore to buy physics and mathematics
books for self-study.</p>
<p>However, due to my inexperience, I bought reference books for
graduate students instead of standard textbooks. The physics book was
full of mathematical symbols with few descriptive texts, and I couldnt
understand it at all. This greatly undermined my confidence, and my
first attempt at self-study ended in failure.</p>
<p>A few years later [around 1989], I went to Wuhu to do business. Soon
after arriving in Wuhu, I met an elder who seemed very kind and wise,
and he spoke in an archaic, scholarly manner. He said to me,</p>
<p>“Let me read your fortune. You are no ordinary person. You might
influence the entire history of mankind in the future”.</p>
<p>Thinking he was a charlatan out to make money, I shook my head and
replied, “Im just a farmer, Im not capable of such things”.</p>
<p>He looked at my left hand and said, “Your left hand has a Tian
character. You are the prophesied saint, the very person we have been
looking for”.</p>
<p>I checked my left hand and didnt see any field character. But when
the elder gestured over my hand, there indeed appeared to be such a
character, which I had never noticed before.</p>
<p>I responded, “Nonsense, what saint am I? Am I going to be a world
leader or the President of the Earth?”</p>
<p>The elder replied, “As society progresses and becomes more
democratic, politicians and presidents in democratic countries will
merely be clowns”.</p>
<p>At that time, I admired Western democracy, but when it came to the
idea of elder, I immediately argued against it, “If leaders in
democratic countries are clowns, does that mean leaders in dictatorships
are noble?”</p>
<p>The elder laughed a bit and said, “I didnt make myself clear. Leaders
in democratic countries are like clowns who entertain children. They are
actors who can only perform. Every action they take is directed by
experts behind the scenes, and they dont engage in behavior that could
drastically affect daily life. In the future, it will not be
politicians, but rather great scientists and significant scientific
discoveries, that will profoundly change human life”.</p>
<p>“I dont see how this relates to me at all”, I replied.</p>
<p>The elder said, “You are wrong. You have been bestowed with divine
science. Use this divine knowledge to benefit humanity”.</p>
<p>This reminded me immediately of the technological theories I had
obtained from aliens, which startled me, but I still didnt believe him.
When I asked how he knew about me, he said he was part of “the circle”
(at that time, I had learned from someone claiming to be from Shanghai
that “the circle” referred to a group of people with paranormal
abilities related to aliens hiding on Earth. These individuals were
bound by internal constraints and could not reveal their identities or
abilities to the outside world, or they would face severe punishment).
However, I pretended not to know about this.</p>
<p>He then recited my hometown address, saying he had visited there and
described some details about the area around my house. He had heard I
moved to Wuhu, so he came here to find me.</p>
<p>I asked him, “What do you want from me? If you have paranormal
abilities, why not get me involved in national research?”</p>
<p>The elder replied, “I want you to diligently study modern scientific
knowledge and explain the gods science in our language. Only then will
your ideas be accepted by the general public”.</p>
<p>He also told me that wealth and status are ordained by heaven, and
that one shouldnt be overly concerned with acquiring them. He indirectly
criticized me for thinking about wealth and status without having
formally engaged in scientific research.</p>
<p>Later, he roughly predicted my future life experiences, which,
looking back now, have mostly come true.</p>
<p>Finally, he said, “In the future, many will curse you and many will
praise you, but these people will not change your destiny. You will
remain who you are. It is only with the help of noble people that you
will be accepted by society”.</p>
<p>I eagerly asked who this noble person could be who would help me. The
elder replied, “Every two thousand years, China produces a sage. This
sage, coming after you, can help you”. After saying this, the elder
left.</p>
<p>Now, when I think about it, “after the sage” might mean after
Confucius. Could this noble person be surnamed Kong?</p>
<p>Inspired by the elders, I went to some bookstores in Wuhu to buy
physics textbooks. Strangely enough, despite Wuhus developed commerce in
1989, it was difficult to find suitable textbooks. These books were not
ideal either; they only briefly mentioned relativity without
mathematical proof. Moreover, I never managed to find the corresponding
mathematics textbooks. I also bought some books from a waste station,
but they were not suitable for self-study either.</p>
<p>Troublingly, I would get headaches whenever I looked at textbooks,
realizing that I lacked strong willpower, disappointing the elders
expectations.</p>
<p>In Wuhu, my self-study made no substantial progress, especially in
advanced physics and mathematics, which I found completely inaccessible.
This created fear and feelings of inferiority, as I believed I didnt
have the capability to understand these subjects. However, I did gain a
general understanding of physics in Wuhu, but no knowledge of
mathematics.</p>
<p>Later, I met a tall, heavyset man who boasted about being a qigong
master. I didnt believe him; in my view, martial artists are supposed to
be slim-waisted with broad arms, not round-bellied.</p>
<p>Once, when he was cornered by my skepticism, he said, “Extend your
hand and let me try something”.</p>
<p>I stretched out my hand, and he casually tapped my arm with his
little finger. A shock of pain hit me, and my arm immediately swelled
up, sticking to the arm like a small mudfish.</p>
<p>This experience made me truly appreciate his skills and sparked my
intense interest in qigong. In Wuhu, I learned some basic knowledge of
qigong from the heavyset man.</p>
<p>Entering the world of qigong isnt difficult; the challenge is in
persisting with daily morning practice. I didnt keep it up for more than
a few mornings due to laziness and never managed to get up early again.
Later, I invented a method of practicing qigong while lying in bed.
Surprisingly, this bed-based qigong practice opened up a strange new
world for me.</p>
<p>When practicing qigong, one must suppress their self-awareness, then
enter a state that seems both thoughtful and dazed. In this state of
semi-consciousness, I often had clearer visions of the strange dreams I
experienced. I also recalled many details of my encounter with the alien
planet at the age of 19.</p>
<p>Practicing Qigong shifted me from passively waiting to actively
searching. In my dreams, I felt like I was living on an alien planet,
working, learning, and interacting with others there.</p>
<p>From the information I received, the technology of the people on this
planet was highly advanced. I felt that it might take thousands, or even
tens of thousands of years for Earth to reach their level of
technological development. Their perspectives on time, space, fields,
matter, and the universe were quite different from ours on Earth.</p>
<p>After spending a few years in Wuhu and returning home, due to our
familys financial struggles, I often worked on the farm during the day
and went fishing at night. The harsh and exceptionally laborious life,
not to mention its tedious and flavorless nature, offered no prospects
for improvement and was exhausting.</p>
<p>Later, I got married, but my relationship with my wife was troubled.
We often argued, mainly over money and economic difficulties. My wife
was fierce, nagging, and would create problems out of nothing. I felt
powerless to change my situation and often endured her unwarranted
insults.</p>
<p>At that time, my primary thought was how to get ahead or find a
better living environment. Naturally, I thought that my only unique
attributes were having two me and my encounter with aliens at the age of
19. I believed that focusing on these aspects was the only way to escape
my predicament.</p>
<p>A simple idea was to ask my other “me” for advanced physical theories
and present them as my own to gain fame. I had always been interested in
physics more than other subjects during my schooling.</p>
<p>From that time, I started to take this seriously and began self-study
again.</p>
<p>Initially, I would occasionally ask my other “me” about concepts like
time, space, and fields. But afterward, I started researching these
topics with a purpose, though the progress was very challenging.</p>
<p>Although I could obtain explanations about the essence of physical
concepts like time, fields, mass, charge, light, the speed of light,
energy, and so on from my other “me”—who could provide accurate
definitions of these physical notions—I found it difficult to connect
these isolated concepts into a cohesive theoretical system, especially
when it came to applying mathematics, which was even more
challenging.</p>
<p>I often thought that the aliens had given me these theoretical
points, but to connect these points into a line, I needed to make my own
efforts.</p>
<p>Years later, upon reflecting calmly, I realized that apart from the
theories provided by the aliens, I actually had nothing of my own. I
understood that I was just an ordinary person. However, the words of
that elder in Wuhu, who claimed I would significantly impact human
history, echoed in my ears and plunged me into contradiction.</p>
<p>In fact, for a long time, it was the words of that elder from Wuhu
that sustained my belief. Without him, I might have given up researching
and promoting alien technology long ago.</p>
<p>Whenever I thought of the elder from Wuhu, speaking in classical
Chinese with his hands behind his back, I encouraged myself, silently
repeating in my mind: “I am not an ordinary person; I might influence
human history; I must keep going—”</p>
<p>Now, when I think about it, the key to my failure during that period
was my lack of interest in mathematics and not studying it. Not having
suitable textbooks was also a crucial factor. Of course, being
constantly busy with making a living, enduring my wifes frequent,
baseless nagging and insults, and my laziness and weak willpower were
major reasons too.</p>
<p>I also wrote many letters to the Institute of Physics at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, but each time, they said it was irrelevant to them,
and nothing came of it.</p>
<p>I wrote many letters to universities and relevant organizations. I
personally visited these institutions and universities like the
University of Science and Technology of China, but almost always
received the same response: “Get out!” I was often chased out like
chasing away a dog by the gatekeepers.</p>
<p>I also approached television stations and news media to share my
story. Once, I called a TV station, and the person who answered at the
Anhui Jingshi Channels First Time program mocked me, saying, “...You
want us to interview you just because you say so? Who do you think you
are?”</p>
<p>No one paid attention to me, and gradually, I lost confidence.</p>
<p>For quite some time, I gave up on this matter and stopped pursuing
it.</p>
<p>I also submitted many articles, but generally received no responses.
One editor replied to me, saying: “---You have some good, unique ideas,
but you need to express these in mathematical terms. Mathematics is the
universal language of physics. Without mathematics, physics cannot be
clearly explained, and theres no definitive conclusion. I dont expect
you to know advanced mathematics like Riemannian geometry or Fourier
analysis, but you dont even have the simplest calculus---”</p>
<p>Later, various difficulties in life made me resolve again to
self-study, determined to clearly explain the advanced theories of
aliens and make a name for myself.</p>
<p>A cousin of mine, who teaches in Hefei and has been to university,
brought me a few books. The books he brought were standard textbooks,
Tsinghua Universitys <em>General Physics</em> and <em>Advanced
Mathematics</em>, which were very suitable for self-study, especially
the mathematics book, as it was easy to understand.</p>
<p>With these easy-to-understand textbooks, I made quick progress.</p>
<p>When the internet reached rural areas, I shifted my focus online,
using my spare time to research and promote alien technology, especially
their Unified Field Theory and Artificial Field Scanning technology.</p>
<p>Now, by searching online for “Unified Field Theory 6th Edition”,
“Artificial Field Scanning”, “Zhang Xiangqian”, “Unveiling the
Principles of Alien UFOs” and so on, you can find the advanced
scientific theories related to alien technology that I have posted
online.</p>
<p>I have been promoting alien technology for 38 years now, but
unfortunately, it still hasnt garnered societal attention or
significance. This is puzzling not only to many netizens but also to
myself, especially since we are in the era of the internet.</p>
<p>I plan to continue writing articles and science fiction novels online
in hopes of gaining fame. Once I become well-known, the advanced
technology of alien Artificial Field Scanning I bring will undoubtedly
be taken seriously by society. Even if some people are unhappy, nobody
will be able to stop it.</p>
<p>This might be the only way for me to succeed. Many netizens have
suggested that I conduct experiments, and of course, I wont give up on
that. Im already collaborating with netizens to conduct experiments.
However, I have an intuition that, given our poor conditions and limited
resources, the likelihood of success in these experiments is not
high.</p>
<h2 id="my-mother">My mother</h2>
<p>My mother was born near a ferry in Shitou Town, Lujiang County, in a
family of six people. Their household was extremely impoverished.</p>
<p>At just under 10 years old, my mother was taken by her relatives to
my ancestral home in Xiaohuying of Niu Shou commune, Lujiang County, to
be raised as a child bride (Tongyangxi). Tragically, soon after her
move, all five members of my mothers original family starved to
death.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/fQ4dUB82pEANHSX.png" width="461" height="346"></p>
<p>My mother</p>
<p>The boy my mother was initially destined to marry also succumbed to
starvation. His family, too, was in dire poverty and couldnt look after
my mother.</p>
<p>I heard that for a while, my mother survived on her own, foraging for
wild fruits and plants, nearly starving herself.</p>
<p>Later, considering that my mother had no family left, the boys family
introduced her to my father, who lived nearby and shared the same
surname with them. Moreover, my father was an exceptionally honest and
kind-hearted man.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/niwG5vhN91tBAuR.png" width="344" height="257"></p>
<p>My father</p>
<p>In the many decades Ive lived, Ive never seen my parents argue even
once. My father was hardworking, and skilled in fishing and harvesting
lotus root, ensuring my mother no longer faced the threat of hunger.</p>
<p>My father had four brothers and two sisters; one of the brothers
starved to death. My grandmother looked down on my mother due to her
humble origins, frequently belittling and mistreating her, and always
favoring her other three daughters-in-law over my mother.</p>
<p>However, my mother was extraordinarily kind and never held any
grudges against her mother-in-law. When my grandparents grew old and
penniless, they had given all they had to their other three
daughters-in-law and even had to where to stay, ironically, those
daughters-in-law never cared about them.</p>
<p>My father built a house for them next to ours. In their old age, only
my mother cared for them without ever complaining.</p>
<p>On her deathbed, my grandmother, a devout Christian, told my
mother,</p>
<p>“I owe you, Zhou Maozi (my mothers nickname). Ill repay your kindness
in heaven.” Both my mother and grandmother were devout Christians.</p>
<p>My mother had four children: me, an older brother, and two younger
sisters. I was my mothers favorite, and she greatly influenced my
personality.</p>
<p>She was kind, upright, persistent, non-confrontational, never wanting
to burden others, never speaking ill behind anyones back, and silently
bearing all hardships without complaint. Her traits deeply influenced
me.</p>
<p>She often advised, “Dont squabble with others over something. Instead
of spending time arguing, use that time to earn money and buy it.”</p>
<p>As far back as I can remember, the only word to describe our
household was “poor,” a kind of poverty beyond ordinary
comprehension.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/S5hjtwCmByWK3ib.png" width="407" height="304"></p>
<p>My mother</p>
<p>Back then, I didnt have clothes to wear except a pair of underwear.
When they were being washed, I had to go to school in a long sweatshirt,
staying in the classroom even not daring to move around.</p>
<p>I didnt have shoes, either. My feet would get frostbite in the fall.
In winter, I had to stand on straw.</p>
<p>There was no bed. At night, I would sleep on makeshift wooden
boards.</p>
<p>There was no mosquito net, making mosquitoes the nightmare of my
childhood.</p>
<p>On rainy days, the house would leak everywhere.</p>
<p>I often went hungry. All my childhood dreams and fantasies were about
food. I was frequently scolded by adults for being greedy. I thought I
would amount to nothing when I grew up.</p>
<p>Whenever I fell ill, I never saw a doctor. There was a girl living
next door, everyone called her “Little Eight”. I asked my mother, “She
only has one sister and one brother. Why call her Little Eight instead
of Little Three?”</p>
<p>“All the others are dead,” my mother replied lightly.</p>
<p>Once, I fell seriously ill. My mother, feeling helpless, borrowed
money from my uncle to treat me at the hospital. At that time, it was
because my uncle had just lost a child and he could relate to our
context. Otherwise, he wouldnt have lent the money. My mother knew him
well, and never had she borrowed money from him before. My father might
have been away at the time.</p>
<p>On the way to the hospital, a fellow villager told my mother, “Why
take a dying child to the hospital? You could be scolded by the doctor,
and more importantly, you are wasting money. You should just go home and
bury him.”</p>
<p>After my elder brother got married, he immediately moved out of our
parents’ house. But I stayed with them until their last days.</p>
<p>While living with my parents, even though my wife was fierce and
often scolded me and insulted my parents, she always sent a share of
dishes with my parents every time she cooked. However, my two
sisters-in-law never did this.</p>
<p>Every New Year, my wife would respectfully give my parents red
envelopes, saying its better to give money to the real gods (parents)
than to those fake ones in temples. My sisters-in-law never gave them a
cent.</p>
<p>When my father was diagnosed with cancer, my wife immediately
contributed over ten thousand yuan for treatment. Later on, she
contributed even more. My brother and his wife, however, didnt give a
dime. My brother even secretly took the medical insurance money meant
for my fathers cancer treatment. No matter how firmly we demanded it
back, he refused to return the money. He didnt contribute to the medical
expenses and even profited a few thousand yuan from it.</p>
<p>When my mother had a cerebral thrombosis and needed over ten thousand
yuan for treatment, my brother and his wife didnt contribute at all.
When I asked him to look after our mother in hospital, he refused.</p>
<p>My brothers ex-wife had a bad character. She said to my brother, “You
go to work at someone’s house during the day [as a carpenter], and go
fishing with a net at night.” She didnt consider my brothers rest at
all.</p>
<p>She harbored an inexplicable resentment towards my parents. Once, my
parents killed a pig they had raised and gifted them a pair of pigs
feet. My brother stewed the pig feet but before he could eat them, he
had to travel to Ying Shang county.</p>
<p>What should we do with these trotters? Lets give them to mother and
father, my brother suggested.</p>
<p>Id rather throw them away than let that old pig couple have them, my
sister-in-law retorted. She then discarded the trotters into the weeds
outside their door. She referring to my kind-hearted parents as an old
pig couple made my blood boil with anger, seeing red.</p>
<p>My elder brothers wife, whom he married later, was no good either.
One time, my mother came to my countryside small shop in tears and told
me that my sister-in-law had hit her with the back of a kitchen
knife.</p>
<p>I took my mother and went to confront my sister-in-law. Why did you
hit my mother? I demanded.</p>
<p>She was washing clothes and kept leaving them dirty, my sister-in-law
replied.</p>
<p>She didnt provide me with detergent; how could I get them clean? my
mother countered.</p>
<p>Well, your son runs a supermarket, and theres plenty of detergent
there. Why dont you go get some? my sister-in-law retorted
sarcastically.</p>
<p>Its inappropriate for me to take from my younger sons store while
working for you all, my mother responded.</p>
<p>Why do you always favor your younger son? You just love him and his
wife more than us, dont you? my sister-in-law pressed.</p>
<p>All my basic needs, including when I fall sick, are taken care of by
him. You all dont contribute a dime. How do you expect me to favor you?
my mother said.</p>
<p>You ungrateful woman! Throughout the year, you dont contribute
anything, neglecting your duties, yet do you still demand to be treated
well? On what grounds? If my husband were here today, I would deal with
you in his presence! I was so furious that I almost lost control and
raised my hand to her.</p>
<p>Go on then, hit me! my sister-in-law challenged, fearless. At this
point, a few local Christians who had heard about my mother being struck
by my sister-in-law came rushing over. They loudly exclaimed,</p>
<p>Your mother-in-law is so kind-hearted; how could you possibly strike
her? Surely the devil has possessed you...</p>
<p>Later, with the mediation of the Christians, I relocated my mother to
live near our supermarket, away from my brother and his wife. She had
previously lived next door to them.</p>
<p>After my father fell ill and passed away, my mother lived alone,
residing next to my elder brother.</p>
<p>Seven days after my fathers passing, my brother called, instructing
me to come over to his place. I asked him what the matter was.</p>
<p>Whats the matter? Its the seventh day after our fathers death, what
do you think? He hung up immediately after.</p>
<p>In our local customs, the seventh day after an elders passing is
significant (called “Touqi”, first seven days). It involves a ritual
where a local villager, often responsible for conducting funerals, makes
paper models of houses, cars, TVs, refrigerators, and other items. These
are burnt on the night of the seventh day at the deceaseds gravesite,
symbolizing gifts to the departed.</p>
<p>That day, I was swamped with business and couldnt visit my brother.
Later in the evening, he called again, inviting me for dinner. I
declined, citing my busy schedule. He informed me that my two
brothers-in-law, Xiao Luo (小罗) and Xiao Pan (小潘), were present and
that there were matters they needed to discuss.”</p>
<p>I rushed to my brothers house on my electric bike, and my
sister-in-law warmly invited me to sit down for a meal. Also present
were two of my elder relatives from nearby and a stranger. My brother
pointed to the stranger, a slim, dark-skinned middle-aged man, and said
to me,</p>
<p>“On the seventh day after our fathers passing, according to our local
customs, we need to burn a paper effigy for him. Today, we invited Mr.
Yan, the ritualist, to help. He worked all day to prepare it and burned
it at our fathers grave. We know youve been busy, so we didnt insist on
your coming. The cost of the effigy was 1,800 yuan. The four of us,
including our two brothers-in-law, each owe 450 yuan. You need to pay
the full 450 yuan.”</p>
<p>“You three can pay. I never asked for a paper effigy for our father,
nor did I suggest it. I neither oppose nor support your decision. You
keep your own opinions and have the right to make the decision. I cant
represent you. But, you cant represent me, either. Whoever wanted to
burn the effigy should pay,” I replied coldly.</p>
<p>My words angered my brother. “Ah Qian, we didnt ask you to come today
because we knew you were busy, but how dare you not pay?!”</p>
<p>I responded, “Elder brother, Im warning you this once, if you push me
further, next time Ill kick your ass. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“I do, I do. Take a seat and fill your stomach. Were just trying to
reason with you,” my brother said, softening his tone.</p>
<p>The two elder relatives immediately criticized me,</p>
<p>“Ah’ Qian<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, youre wrong. Burning an effigy on
the seventh day after someones death is a tradition here. Every family
does it. Why are you against it? We thought you were reasonable. Arent
you afraid the villagers will say youre unfilial?”</p>
<p>The ritualist chimed in, “Ive seen many situations like this. In
every group of siblings, theres always one whos cunning and stingy. When
its time to share expenses, they try to shirk their responsibilities.
Looking at you, Ah Qian, you dont seem deceptive, but you seem reluctant
to spend 450 yuan for your father. I guess youre not someone who can
achieve great things, huh? Haha.”</p>
<p>I immediately retorted, “Mr. Yan, youre wrong. When it comes to
spending money on my parents, Im the most willing. Of their four
children, Im the only one who provides for their living expenses. From
rice to laundry detergent, condiments, beer, and all other necessities,
Ive supplied everything.</p>
<p>“Whenever my mother falls ill, which is often, Im the one taking her
to the hospital and covering the medical bills. My brother contributes
nothing and stays away.</p>
<p>“My two sisters and their husbands live far away, so I dont blame
them. But my brother, who lives next to our parents, neglects them. Is
that right?</p>
<p>“If Im lying, ask my brother here if Ive said anything untrue.”</p>
<p>Although my wife is very aggressive, she often gives meat and clothes
to my parents. Every year during the Chinese New Year, she gives red
envelopes with several hundred yuan to each of my parents. These are all
because my actions have influenced her.</p>
<p>“You can ask my elder brother and sister-in-law now, have they ever
given my parents a penny in recent years? Have they given them a pound
of meat, a piece of clothing, or a piece of anything?</p>
<p>“Just a few days ago, my mother said that the TV was broken, and I
bought a color TV worth over a thousand yuan. Do I ask the three of them
to share the money?”</p>
<p>The ritualist laughed and asked my brother, “All these things your
younger brother said cant all be true, can they? Judging by his looks,
he doesn’t seem that generous, does he?”</p>
<p>My brother just coughed awkwardly without replying.</p>
<p>I continued, “Indeed, Im not a spendthrift. Im frugal, but when it
comes to my parents, I spare no expense. If its unnecessary, I save it.
We should care for our parents as best as we can while theyre alive.</p>
<p>“After theyve passed, spending lavishly on ceremonies wont benefit
them. Instead, it goes into the pockets of people like you, the
ritualists.</p>
<p>“Many in China neglect their parents when theyre alive but go all out
in their funerals. Such hypocrisy! Most of these people have terrible
character, and I greatly despise them.”</p>
<p>I stood up without eating and headed out. As I left, I still heard
the ritualist asking the two elder relatives if what I said was true.
They replied, “Everything he said is true. Hes a unique individual, very
outspoken. Even the cadres fear him.”</p>
<p>One night, my mother suffered a cerebral thrombosis. My daughter
found her, and together with my brother-in-law, we rushed her to the
hospital. Though her life was saved, she was left severely incapacitated
and couldnt care for herself.</p>
<p>My brother showed no concern. He didnt even visit her once in the
hospital, let alone contribute to the medical bills. My sister-in-law,
after our stern insistence, visited my mother in the hospital with some
health supplements once but then ignored her.</p>
<p>They always want the benefits but shirk responsibilities.</p>
<p>After my mother became paralyzed, I took care of her alone for five
years until she passed away. My older brother never bothered to inquire
about our mother. My two younger sisters, living far away and
overwhelmed with their own lives and financial pressures, could only
visit her occasionally.</p>
<p>My wife felt angry about my brother’s indifference, feeling that we
were being treated unfairly. Over the five years, she berated me
countless times over this issue. One day, after hours of shouting, she
gave me an ultimatum,</p>
<p>“Zhang Xiangqian, you either choose your mother or me. Decide
overnight. If you choose your mother, well divorce tomorrow. Our
daughter will be with me, the son with you, the supermarket goes to you,
and Ill take the house in our hometown.”</p>
<p>Seeing the situation turning bad, my mother-in-law hastily knelt
before us, begging us to stop quarreling.</p>
<p>The next day, with the household registration book in hand, my wife
demanded, “Have you made up your mind? Its either me or your mother. If
you choose her, lets go to the civil affairs bureau and end our
marriage.”</p>
<p>I replied,</p>
<p>“I dont want to divorce; being single would make me the laughing
stock in our village. But someone has to care for my mother. I cant just
abandon her. Its not about me being extraordinarily good or dutiful; I
have no other choice.</p>
<p>“Caring for my sick mother just proves Im a normal human being.
Ignoring her like my brother does makes one heartless. Arent you afraid
of a man who could abandon his own sick mother? If he can do that to
her, how will he treat his wife? How can you sleep beside such a man
without fear?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, my wife fell silent. Perhaps she realized that a
compassionate and reliable man is truly invaluable in a womans life.</p>
<p>In the last days before my mothers death, while she was basking in
the sun, seeming more spirited than usual, she whispered to me, “Ah’
Qian, I want to give you the money I saved.”</p>
<p>“Keep your money for your own expenses,” I replied. I was always busy
making a living and didnt have time to care for my mother. To
compensate, I often gave her money for groceries, but she hesitated to
spend it, thus accumulating some savings. There was a time when she
lived alone.</p>
<p>“Soon, there wont be another chance…” she murmured.</p>
<p>A few days later, while I was helping her dress and feeding her
porridge, she suddenly collapsed on the table. By the time I reached
her, her limbs had stiffened. She passed away shortly after.</p>
<p>My brother did not attend our mothers funeral and remained
indifferent, not contributing a penny. My wife, having no outlet for her
anger, unleashed it on me again.</p>
<p>As some relatives prepared to burn my mothers clothes, someone
suggested checking them for hidden money.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, my wife shouted, “Dont search! Who dares to? Just
burn everything!”</p>
<p>It struck me as odd; my wife, who is extremely money-minded. Now did
she seem to disdain even my mothers money due to resentment?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, her authority prevailed. The clothes were burnt, and
whether they contained money remains unknown.</p>
<p>When my mother was taken to the Lujiang County Crematorium, seeing
the smoke drift into the sky, I thought, perhaps only the wealthy fear
death. For those whove suffered, death might be a relief. I wondered if
my mother had truly reached heaven, where the ugliness and cruelty of
the human world shouldn’t exist.</p>

<p>My families</p>
<h2 id="my-wife-and-my-small-shop-in-the-countryside">My wife and my
small shop in the countryside</h2>
<p>My wife wasnt introduced to me by a matchmaker; I met her myself.
Back in those days, in our rural area, love marriages were quite rare.
Most marriages were arranged by matchmakers or parents.</p>
<p>When I first met her, I thought she was fairly pretty, had a good
physique, and was quite robust. However, there was a fierceness in her
demeanor.</p>
<p>I had been running a small business in Wuhu for a few years, and I
missed the ideal age for finding a partner. By the time I was 26 or 27,
many people in the countryside were already married. At that time, my
family was going through financial difficulties, and she was six years
younger than me. So, I didnt mind this particular shortcoming.</p>
<p>However, it took me several years of marriage to truly understand
just how fierce she could be, and it wasnt ordinary fierceness; it was a
terrifying kind of fierceness, coupled with extreme stubbornness and
unreasonable behavior.</p>
<p>After we got married, we used to have frequent and intense arguments,
and she was usually the one who initiated them. The main reasons behind
our arguments were her overly picky and demanding nature, her
dissatisfaction with many things, and financial issues.</p>
<p>I dont smoke, drink, or gamble, and I dont have any other major
expenses. I primarily work hard, but my income is not high. Naturally,
she was dissatisfied because women tend to be naturally inclined towards
wealth.</p>
<p>For ordinary people without influential backgrounds, the path to
prosperity is through business. Working as a laborer or doing odd jobs
wont make you wealthy.</p>
<p>I explained these principles to her, but she strongly disliked them.
She had a habit of holding onto money tightly once it was in her hands.
Starting a business requires capital, so I didnt have a strong desire to
go into business with her.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/w1tyKEnQfmo32xI.png" width="399" height="299"></p>
<p>Me and my wife</p>
<p>In the first few years of our marriage, I used to dig for eels every
year, which required no initial investment – just a large shovel.</p>
<p>Looking back, those were the happiest times of my life. When I left
home and went to the fields, I left behind my wifes constant nagging,
complaints, and scolding. I felt remarkably content. Returning home in
the evening, a vendor would come to buy the eels. I handed the money
over to my wife, and that was the end of my involvement.</p>
<p>The next day, I would ask my wife for money to have lunch at a
restaurant, then head out to dig for eels again.</p>
<p>Back then, a restaurant meal cost 5 yuan, but my wife often gave me
only 4 yuan, which made me uncomfortable. Eventually, I started hiding
my money.</p>
<p>What really upset me was one winter day when a few of us walked more
than 10 miles. Suddenly, it began to rain heavily, and it just wouldnt
stop. Helpless, we had to run back in the pouring rain. I got soaked, to
the point that even my underwear was drenched. It was freezing, so we
had to keep running to generate some heat. My legs even cramped up from
running.</p>
<p>When I got home, I sat on the edge of the bed to change my clothes.
Suddenly, my wife shouted, “What the hell, are you blind? You wet the
bedsheets!”</p>
<p>I had just moved to sit on a stool when she yelled again, “The stool
is dirty!”</p>
<p>I had no choice but to stand up while changing my clothes and asked,
“Whats gotten into you today? Did you eat gunpowder or something?”</p>
<p>“You [expletive], you didnt even catch a single eel!” She started
scolding me incessantly.</p>
<p>In 1996, I applied for a pen patent, and in 1997, some companies in
Hong Kong and Guangdong expressed interest in buying my patent. They
said my patent needed evaluation, and once it was evaluated, they would
purchase it. I spent several thousand yuan [which was several years
worth of our income] to get the patent evaluated. However, these
companies disappeared without a trace, and I realized I had been
scammed.</p>
<p>This scam was catastrophic for me. My wife scolded me countless times
because of it and completely lost respect for me. She became extremely
distrustful of me. From then on, no matter what investment I wanted to
make or the business I wanted to start, she vehemently opposed it and
imposed strict financial restrictions on me.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have been researching and promoting
extraterrestrial Artificial Field Scanning technology and the Unified
Field Theory. I frequently write articles and publish papers online,
sharing my childhood encounters with extraterrestrial beings.</p>
<p>Some educated people and village officials in our area, when they see
my wife, say,</p>
<p>“Your husband, Zhang Xiangqian, is remarkable. He has a big online
following, and his papers have been published in the United States. We
heard that people from Beijing have come to visit him.”</p>
<p>Whenever my wife hears such comments, she has a habit of publicly
scolding me to save face, promptly adding, “My husband, Aqian, got
cheated out of thousands of yuan doing that thing.”</p>
<p>My father-in-law often tells me, “Aqian, you need to have a trade.
Just digging for eels wont get you anywhere. Youre covered in mud all
the time, and people look down on you.”</p>
<p>In 1999, I borrowed 3,500 yuan from my mother-in-law and opened an
electric welding repair shop in Sanhe Town with my older brother. I had
never done welding before, but my brother knew how. His previous
business had just failed, and he had no money to invest, so all the
money came from me. I didnt dare ask my wife for money.</p>
<p>Initially, my wife neither opposed nor supported the welding shop. My
sister-in-law was a real troublemaker, constantly pressuring my brother
to leave. Her reasoning was simple: she wanted to see me fail, to see
how someone who had never done welding before would manage to run an
electric welding repair shop.</p>
<p>Eventually, my wife joined in the arguments. The quarrels escalated,
and my brother was so stressed that he began coughing up blood. Seeing
him spitting fresh blood on the ground, I had no choice but to let him
leave.</p>
<p>I worked alone, welding at night repeatedly. I endured several bouts
of severe eye strain and, over time, mastered the art of welding.</p>
<p>After my brother left, there were very few customers at the electric
welding repair shop, and tax collectors and fee collectors would often
come knocking. Amid my wifes relentless opposition and quarrels, the
repair shop was eventually closed.</p>
<p>I remember one winter day when she hid the key to my repair shop. I
searched everywhere for it, like a desperate scavenger hunt, until I
finally found it. Otherwise, I might have had to spend a night outside
in the cold repair shop.</p>
<p>I brought all the equipment from the repair shop back home and
started digging for eels again. However, after that incident, I was
determined to reopen the repair shop because I strongly felt that life
was tough and I needed a stable source of income.</p>
<p>I rented a piece of land at the village entrance and started planning
for the repair shop. At first, my wife neither supported nor opposed the
idea. All the money I earned from digging eels went to her, but she
never shared a cent.</p>
<p>I dug eels for a while, bought bricks, dug more eels, and bought roof
tiles, so my rural electric welding repair shop was about to be
established.</p>
<p>To raise the shops floor level, we had to fill it with soil since the
ground was too low. I hired a tractor driver who asked me,</p>
<p>“Why dont you call your wife to help you dig the soil? Itll be
quicker.”</p>
<p>In my mind, I thought my wife was tough, so I didnt dare ask her.
However, I felt it wasnt right to speak ill of her in front of others,
so I said, “Shes busy with something else.”</p>
<p>As I was talking, my wife suddenly appeared in front of me, hands on
her hips, questioning why I wanted to fill the soil. “Why are you
filling soil? Are you trying to bury yourself?”</p>
<p>We only completed half of the soil filling, and then it was stopped
due to my wifes threats. This left severe consequences, and whenever it
rained heavily, the repair shop floor would be flooded.</p>
<p>The repair shop operated for some time and received praise from many
villagers. It began to make money due to the low costs in the
countryside. However, my wife intensified her arguments.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wondered why she continued to argue and oppose the repair
shop when it was making money.</p>
<p>I welded a large iron gate for the shop, and at night, if my wifes
nagging got to me, I would go to the repair shop, find a wooden board,
and sleep there without taking off my clothes.</p>
<p>One night, after being verbally abused by my wife for over an hour
without any reason, I remained silent. She showed no sign of stopping,
so I quietly made my way to the electric welding repair shop, which was
about a mile away from home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that night, there were too many mosquitoes. I wished
for a small store where I could buy some mosquito repellent.</p>
<p>The idea of opening a small store resurfaced in my mind. However,
fearing my wifes opposition, I often imagined the scene where the first
batch of store goods arrived home, and my wife would hysterically throw
everything out. So, I hesitated for a long time.</p>
<p>During the next years Spring Festival, on the eighth day of the first
lunar month, many guests, most of whom were from my wifes side of the
family, came to our house. I felt it was an opportunity and hurried to
Sanhe Town to distribute some small goods, totaling 40 yuan, mainly
childrens snacks. When my wife saw that I had actually delivered goods
for a store, she planned to open one. Although it was unexpected, she
didnt argue, possibly to save face in front of her family.</p>
<p>Previously, when I mentioned wanting to open a store, my wife had
glared at me and said, “Dare you!”</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/mL1HneuaYKJNyq2.png" width="475" height="357"></p>
<p>My wife gave some snacks to the children from her family during the
Spring Festival, and everyone was happy. Since it was the lunar new
year, the children had received red envelopes with money, and the 40
yuan worth of snacks quickly sold out. My wife urged me to distribute
more goods in the streets.</p>
<p>I carefully chose the right time, and the small store initially
received her support. The beginning went smoothly, and considering how
tumultuous it was when I first opened the repair shop, I couldnt believe
how smoothly the small store was progressing.</p>
<p>However, I didnt anticipate that this small store would lift us out
of poverty, become our main source of income, and also the source of our
intense arguments.</p>
<p>After operating the small store for a while, its income far surpassed
that of the repair shop. I decided to go big and expand. The land for my
electric welding repair shop was rented for 100 yuan per year, which,
while not much, was still an expense. If I wanted to expand, I had to
buy it.</p>
<p>To smoothly purchase the land, I brainstormed a plan. I first closed
both the repair shop and the small store, moved to the nearby town of
Tongda, and rented a house to operate for a while. Then, I asked my
father-in-law to convince the landlord to sell me the land.</p>
<p>The landlord thought that with the 100 yuan annual rent for the land
gone, the land was just lying there with no purpose. So, they agreed to
sell it to me for 1,250 yuan.</p>
<p>Once I acquired the land, my father-in-law and I discussed building a
house and expanding the small store. However, my wife overheard our
conversation and barged in, demanding loudly, “This land belongs to
someone else! Why do you want to build on it? Are you out of your
mind?”</p>
<p>“Ive already purchased the land,” I calmly replied, anticipating her
anger.</p>
<p>“Bought it? Why didnt you let me know, huh?” My wife was visibly
upset.</p>
<p>“I couldnt let you know about these things,” my father-in-law
said.</p>
<p>“Last year, the scrapyard owner had a cutting machine for 300 yuan.
He thought Aqian was an honest guy, so he left it for him. A new one
costs 700 yuan, and Aqian didnt dare to ask you for money. He borrowed
from me. When you asked me why Aqian borrowed money, I told you the
truth. And you kept following Aqian, saying,”Why did you buy a cutting
machine? Are you going to cut your head off? Look at you, what kind of
things you say.”</p>
<p>The next day, my wife asked me how much I had spent on buying the
land. “1,250 yuan,” I replied.</p>
<p>My wife immediately got angry. “They practically gave this place away
for free, and nobody wanted it. 1,250 yuan? Hmph! Im going to demand it
back and make things clear with them.” She turned and went to the
landlords house.</p>
<p>I had learned through experience that running a small store in the
countryside could be quite profitable. After half a year of planning, I
was on the verge of achieving my goal. Seeing my wifes angry stride, I
realized that she might ruin my plans. Fortunately, the landlord wasnt
home that day, and my first step toward expanding the store was
successful.</p>
<p>While building the house, the tile workers were from my wifes
hometown, and she made a big scene in front of her family.</p>
<p>Why did she oppose the expansion of the small store? I gradually
understood that it was essentially her mindset of holding onto money
once it was in hand.</p>
<p>She couldnt distinguish between spending and investing. She was
always frugal and unhappy whenever money was spent, leading to arguments
and fights.</p>
<p>Additionally, she liked to take charge of everything, even when she
had no understanding or capability in certain matters. She would often
give arbitrary and reckless instructions. There was no planning,
everything was done on a whim, and she was extremely selfish,
irresponsible, and disrespectful of others opinions. Her explosive
temper was the result of all these characteristics, and thats why she
loved to argue.</p>
<p>Under her strong interference, the small stores building suffered
severe consequences and had to be rebuilt. This cycle of building and
demolishing happened multiple times, wasting a lot of money. Each time,
the construction process started and ended amidst my wifes intense
arguments.</p>
<p>One time, she was particularly harsh with her insults, going on and
on. A tile worker from her hometown couldnt take it anymore and ran back
home. My wife explained that she was scolding me, not him.</p>
<p>The tile worker said, “Why are you scolding Afan? Whats your purpose?
If you didnt want him to rebuild the house, you should have stopped him
from tearing it down. Now that the house is gone, why are you still
scolding him? Is it all over now, or are you going to stop it? I really
dont understand how your mind works.”</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/ansTYb4FyXDZom6.png" width="382" height="288"></p>
<p>The house was completed, and its area expanded several times. I also
built another house specifically for an electric welding and bicycle
repair shop.</p>
<p>I changed the small store sign to “supermarket,” and the business
started booming. However, my wife remained vehemently opposed and
adopted an uncooperative attitude.</p>
<p>By this time, hardly anyone supported her. Every New Year, she would
create a massive commotion, breaking things and turning the house into a
mess.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I had dirty hands from repairing things and a
customer came to buy something, my wife would stand by and refuse to
help as if she had nothing to do with it, which was particularly
infuriating.</p>
<p>One time, it was probably one of the most regrettable incidents. It
happened one evening when someone on QQ asked me about my annual income.
He claimed to be a big boss and offered to give me a large sum of money,
with the annual interest alone exceeding our total annual income. He
advised me not to do anything else and to focus on my research in
Unified Field Theory. Finally, he asked me to open a video call to show
him my face and requested my bank account details.</p>
<p>Just at that moment, someone came to buy cigarettes at our door.
“Afqian, go online later and bring me the cigarettes,” he said
loudly.</p>
<p>I signaled to my wife to get the cigarettes, but she turned her face
away and ignored me. The customer raised his voice, saying, “Hurry up!
Whats going on?”</p>
<p>I signaled to my daughter to get the cigarettes, but she completely
ignored the request.</p>
<p>The customers voice had a certain kind of power, and it frightened
me. I had no choice but to get the cigarettes for him.</p>
<p>At that moment, my daughter sat at the computer desk and told the big
boss, “My dad is a liar. He failed in real life and came online to seek
attention.”</p>
<p>I rushed over and questioned my daughter, “Why did you say your dad
is a liar? Do you know about my encounters with extraterrestrials when I
was a child? Do you know the importance of Unified Field Theory that I
brought?...”</p>
<p>My daughter remained silent, with no signs of remorse on her face,
just a nonchalant and disdainful attitude.</p>
<p>When I looked back at the computer, the big boss had already blocked
me on QQ.</p>
<p>The next day, another netizen on QQ asked me,</p>
<p>“What happened? Yesterday, that big boss was my good friend. He was
ready to give you money, support your research in Unified Field Theory,
and help you break free from your financial struggles. It was me who
convinced him to assist you. How could your daughter call you a liar?
What did you do? How can you focus on research when life is difficult?
He was planning to give you a seven-figure sum, and youll see how
poverty can affect your research.”</p>
<p>After that incident, we often argued because of money.</p>

<p>In front of my hometown house</p>
<h2 id="my-father-died-in-vain">My father died in vain</h2>
<p>My father was born into a poor family and never received an
education; he couldnt even write his own name.</p>
<p>He had four children: I have one older brother and two younger
sisters.</p>
<p>Among us, only I had passable academic results; my two sisters and
brother performed very poorly.</p>
<p>My father held special hopes for me; he wished that I could pass the
exams and escape the peasant life to secure a government job.</p>
<p>Even though I studied very hard, unfortunately, my academic
performance was not great. After finishing junior high, I failed the
high school entrance exam twice and didnt even pass the preliminary
selection, so I had to go back home to work on the farm.</p>
<p>My father was extremely disappointed in me, and the last time I
failed the preliminary exam, he was so angry that he beat me with a
stick.</p>
<p>My father was an upright man and very enthusiastic about helping
others, often doing work for the villagers without charge. Although he
was well-liked, he wasnt good at making money.</p>
<p>A strong impression of poverty marked our childhood — we lacked
sufficient clothing and food. We were always longing for good food, wore
tattered clothes, lived in a dilapidated house, and everything at home
was worn out.</p>
<p>My father was physically strong and optimistic, always cheerful,
unlike me, who often looked worried and distressed.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, he suddenly developed gastric cancer. He
passed away more than a decade ago, and I often miss him. He was an
exceedingly honest and kind person, and he suffered terribly from cancer
before he died.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/oZdPxI7MyAXSVU3.png" width="408" height="306"></p>
<p>My father was originally in excellent health, but his illness stemmed
from a misguided national policy.</p>
<p>In the past, the sale of pork was exclusively managed by food
stations, and private selling of pork was not permitted. This policy was
not bad, as it allowed farmers to access fresh and reliable pork.</p>
<p>Later, as the economy opened up and the market economy began to rise
quietly, this policy clashed sharply with the monopoly of food stations.
Many private sellers started to sell pork secretly, and this gradually
became an open and brazen activity. Because these private sellers
offered lower prices, better service, credit, and home delivery, food
stations quickly went out of business.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, in an attempt to save these failing food stations, the
state enacted a policy to restore their monopolistic status. Private
sellers could only sell meat through food stations and were not allowed
to slaughter the animals themselves. This policy was known as
“designated slaughtering”.</p>
<p>However, by that time, the market economy had already gained
considerable scale. Because it was a monopoly, the food stations set the
wholesale price of pork very high. The private meat sellers had no say
in the matter and had no choice but to accept the situation, losing
their profit margin. These people were extremely dissatisfied with the
“designated slaughtering” policy, resenting it deeply.</p>
<p>The local government also exerted significant effort to stabilize
this policy.</p>
<p>I remember there was a woman in our area who ran a small variety
store; she secretly sold meat behind the store and was discovered by the
food station employees. They confiscated her pork, and a fight ensued
between them.</p>
<p>The food station staff called the local police, who arrested her and
took her to the police station. She continued to curse loudly there, and
somehow, the next day, she was dead. The police said she died of an
illness. Later, the police station and the food station compensated her
family, and the matter was left at that.</p>
<p>As time went on, private operators would officially wholesale some
pork from the food stations and then secretly slaughter their pigs at
home. These privately slaughtered pigs, not subjected to the food
stations extortionate prices, were sold cheaper, and the operators
earned their living from this meat.</p>
<p>For a while, the food stations required each operator to fulfill a
monthly quota of 600 to 900 jin of pork. The wholesale price set by the
food stations for this quota was often very high, sometimes even higher
than the retail market price. Thus, private operators had to rely on
their own slaughtered pork to survive, which made their situation
difficult.</p>
<p>Initially, food stations did not allow private slaughtering, but
later on, as long as private operators met their quotas, the food
stations turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>Sanhe Town in Feixi County, near us, is the largest market town in
the area. Many private pork sellers in the town slaughtered a large
number of pigs and sold the meat at low prices, leading to a significant
price gap between rural areas and the market town for pork.</p>
<p>In the rural areas, pork is the most important food for the
villagers. Typically, their daily meals consist of pork with
cabbage.</p>
<p>My father used to say: “The pork at the food station by our door is
too expensive, and going to Sanhe Town to buy it takes too much time.”
So, he would often go to the town to buy a lot of pork to salt and
preserve it, which we would eat over a long time.</p>
<p>At that time, I didnt live with him, but every time I visited and saw
him eating the salted pork, I would remind him to eat some fresh pork
instead of always having the preserved kind, but he didnt take my advice
seriously.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I came home, I found that the preserved pork had
turned yellow and spoiled, yet my mother couldnt bear to throw it away.
Throwing out the spoiled meat often brought scolding from both my
parents.</p>
<p>When my father was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer, we all
thought about the yellowed preserved meat, but by then, it was too
late.</p>
<p>Many people in the nearby rural areas, like my father, developed
stomach cancer and the majority succumbed to it.</p>
<p>They spent their lives accompanied by yellowed preserved pork.</p>
<p>In recent years, the market economy has swept through urban and rural
China. Because food stations were collectively owned enterprises with
little oversight, corruption, and laziness prevailed until they
gradually closed down and were eliminated.</p>
<p>Farmers can now eat fresh pork again, and with the spread of
refrigerators, the incidence of stomach cancer among them has greatly
reduced.</p>
<p>Some might read my article and wonder how the occurrence of cancer
could be related to national policy. In the history of England, there
was a time when households with windows were taxed, leading many people
to avoid opening windows, which resulted in a significant number of
people suffering from rickets due to a lack of sunlight.</p>
<p>My father was diagnosed with stomach cancer and went to the Bengbu
Cancer Hospital for treatment. He was deceived into the radiology
department and received radiation therapy. At that time, there was no
internet, so we couldnt research whether radiation could treat stomach
cancer.</p>
<p>Back then, an unwritten rule was that the family of the patient had
to give the doctor in charge a few thousand yuan as a “red envelope”.
The chief doctor, Dr. Liu, wanted this bribe, so he misled my brother
and father by claiming that radiation therapy was better than surgery
for stomach cancer. We only found out later that the possibility of
curing stomach cancer with radiation was zero, while surgery had about a
one-third chance of success.</p>
<p>My father fell ill due to incorrect policies, and died because of
corruption in the medical field.</p>
<h2 id="what-changes-have-happened-to-my-body-since-i-returned-from">What
changes have happened to my body since I returned from</h2>
<pre><code>the alien planet?</code></pre>
<p>In the summer of 1985 [That year, I was 19 years old], I lived for a
month on a highly advanced alien planet.</p>
<p>Some netizens have asked me if there were any changes in my body
after returning from the alien planet and how that journey has
influenced my life afterward.</p>
<p>After returning from the alien planet, I felt my energy and physical
strength were exceptionally good. I felt incredibly strong; once, I
pulled over 600 jin on a force-measuring device.</p>
<p>Another time, I measured around 590 jin by pulling on the base of a
weighing scale.</p>
<p>At that time, my body felt very light. I could easily leap over high
earthen walls and wide ditches.</p>
<p>I walked very quickly, and none of my companions, who went
eel-digging with me, could keep up. Now, possibly due to aging and
diabetes, my body feels much heavier.</p>
<p>Even my dreams were different. Back then, I often dreamed of flying,
my body floating in the air like a feather, feeling free and
unrestrained.</p>
<p>The dreamscapes were colorful and constantly changing, often set in
strange and unfamiliar places I had never visited.</p>
<p>I also frequently dreamed of returning to the alien planet, feeling
both excitement and fear. I dreamed about various encounters on the
alien planet, with the most common dream being a terrifying scene where
I was surrounded and entangled by a dense group of snake-like beings [a
smaller parasitic humanoid species on the alien planet, resembling a
hybrid of humans, snakes, eels, and similar elongated animals,
possessing human traits and characteristics of these elongated
creatures], who would penetrate my body.</p>
<p>Now, my dreams often involve struggling in cold water or filthy mud,
being chased by bad people and unable to escape. The scenes are usually
black and white, like gloomy days.</p>
<p>Shortly after returning from the alien planet, my skin felt very
oily. This was because, on the alien planet, I had been absorbed into
the body of a giant parasitic humanoid species being, about five meters
tall. After being trapped inside this giant parasitic humanoid species
for a long time, when I emerged, my body felt as if it had been soaked
in oil for an extended period.</p>
<p>Not only did my skin feel very oily, but also the internal organs
like the intestines, stomach, throat, and urinary tract all had a greasy
feeling. This constantly gave me a sensation of comfort and moisture.
Eating and excreting felt very smooth.</p>
<p>This oily feeling persisted for a few years before gradually fading.
Now, I have the opposite problem, my body feels very dry and brittle,
especially my throat, which is constantly dry and extremely
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This giant parasitic humanoid species, to control my dreams, had
input many sea-life dreamscapes into my brain. After returning to Earth,
these undersea life dreams repeatedly appeared in my dreams.</p>
<p>I also often dreamt of many other parasitic humanoid species. Their
unique odors, imprinted in my subconscious, kept reappearing in my
dreams.</p>
<p>After coming back, I discovered a long, deep indentation at the back
of my head, deep enough to fit half of my index finger. Over 39 years,
the small indentation on my head has gradually healed, now mostly level,
with only a long, scar-like mark remaining.</p>
<p>Im not sure if this is from an alien implant or for some other
reason. I never had it checked at a hospital, so Im unclear whether
theres a chip implant there.</p>
<p>When I first returned from the alien planet, I found myself
involuntarily looking at the lower bodies of young women. During my
month on the alien planet, I was without clothes, and I felt embarrassed
in front of females, involuntarily looking downward. This habit
persisted even after returning to Earth.</p>
<p>On the alien planet, the aliens were actually naked. What appeared as
clothing on their bodies were virtual images created remotely by their
global movement network and information network; they werent real
clothes.</p>
<p>From the time I returned from the alien planet at 19 until I was 26,
when I first encountered a womans body. During those seven years, I was
tormented by an extremely unbearable sexual frustration, which I would
describe as deeply etched and unforgettable.</p>
<p>On the alien planet, I often walked through walls. Back on Earth, I
frequently dreamt of walking through walls. Sometimes I succeeded, other
times I failed. Failing feels very painful, and I would tell myself:
“Just walk lightly without any distracting thoughts, and you can do
it”.</p>
<p>After returning from the alien planet, I didnt immediately remember
everything I saw and heard there. Instead, I felt a strange sense of
unfamiliarity around my home, as if I had been away for many years and
had just returned.</p>
<p>Most of my memories about the alien planet gradually resurfaced in my
dreams. Sometimes, the details I recalled were contradictory, and it was
difficult to distinguish between dreams and actual experiences from the
alien planet, between virtual and real scenes, and even whether they
were from Earth or the alien planet.</p>
<p>The sequence of events from my journey to the alien planet was often
confusing; sometimes, I couldnt tell which event happened first or
last.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked me whether I physically visited the alien planet
or if it was just my soul [consciousness].</p>
<p>I have pondered this question, and many experiences and sensations on
the alien planet suggest that it was indeed my physical body that went
there. I believe there should be a significant difference between dream
sensations and real experiences.</p>
<p>Although some memories are vague, certain details are deeply etched
in my mind and very vivid.</p>
<p>In the first few years after returning, my dream recollections were
clear, and I could remember many details, especially their physics and
mathematics equations. I vaguely knew these were important and noted
them in a notebook.</p>
<p>Once, I left this notebook on a table, and my brother accidentally
got it wet. I scolded him, emphasizing the importance of the content in
the notebook.</p>
<p>After I left, my brother tore up the notebook, leaving only a few
pieces on the table. I regretted not keeping it safe and frantically
asked where the rest of the notebook was.</p>
<p>My brother said it was in the toilet, but I couldnt find it there.
When I asked him again, he ignored me. I was furious but didnt argue
with him, knowing it would be pointless.</p>
<p>He had once torn up my junior high school diploma because someone
teased him, saying, “Your brother, at least, graduated from junior high
school. What about you? You didnt even finish elementary school”.</p>
<p>Now, 39 years have passed, and I have forgotten much of their
scientific theories, as well as the mathematics and physics
equations.</p>
<p>I am now 57 years old, and my memory has declined. It has been 39
years since my journey to the alien planet, so many details have either
been forgotten or have become very blurry.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked me if I had any further contact with the aliens
after returning from the alien planet in 1985.</p>
<p>Since then, I have had no contact with them. Especially now, in my
difficult situation, I wish they would appear again to provide me with
evidence [When I went there, I didnt think to leave behind any physical
evidence, nor did I realize the importance of doing so]. Ive tried
calling out to them in secret, but there has been no effect.</p>
<p>Many netizens say I am lucky to have traveled to an alien planet and
to have had sexual encounters with aliens at the peak of my physical
strength.</p>
<p>The truth is, some of these aliens emitted an extremely intense and
foul smell, a kind of odor we humans on Earth have possibly never
experienced or could even produce. This odor was utterly nauseating.</p>
<p>The sexual organs of their females were often long fleshy tubes that
penetrated deep into my body, especially into my stomach, sometimes
causing intense heartburn and vomiting, to the point of being
unbearable.</p>
<p>If these tubes entered through my urethra, it was often unbearably
painful. When the tubes were removed, they mostly came out bloodied, and
these terrible memories have haunted me for decades.</p>
<p>In one scenario, I was in a large barrel with many aliens. Being
thrown in and plummeting towards the aliens bodies didnt feel wonderful
but more like falling into a forest of steel bars or a nest of entwined,
giant poisonous snakes, inducing extreme fear and disgust.</p>
<p>The aliens appeared small, like kindergarten children, but during
sexual encounters, you immediately felt their incredible strength,
superhuman endurance, and boundless energy. The frequency of their
movements during sex was extremely fast, their bodies like little
motors. Our human bodies could not match their physical
capabilities.</p>
<p>Sexual encounters with them often led to extreme physical exhaustion,
and towards the end, I frequently experienced various
hallucinations.</p>
<p>Just one sexual encounter with them instilled fear in me, and seeing
them again was even more terrifying than encountering a ghost.</p>
<p>They showed no compassion, love, or kindness. They ignored my pleas
for mercy.</p>
<p>They had a strong inclination for sexual aggression. If I suddenly
appeared among them, several would use their fleshy tubes to enter my
body through my mouth and anus simultaneously, pulling in different
directions, causing intense pain in my internal organs.</p>
<p>If no one had intervened, I might have lost my life within
minutes.</p>
<p>My journey to the alien planet also brought immense psychological
pain, a kind of inexplicable anxiety that I havent been able to escape
for decades.</p>
<p>Im still frantically posting online, promoting alien technology. This
isnt because of diligence or grand ambitions but due to an unexplainable
urgency, as if a demon is driving me from behind, with a voice
constantly commanding me to ensure society takes alien technology
seriously.</p>
<p>Its likely that the aliens implanted some kind of program in me,
driving me to do these things. For decades, maybe even my whole life, I
might be controlled by this program and unable to escape.</p>
<p>This possibility is significant. Why are humans born with a fear of
darkness? Even infants are scared of snakes, bats, lions, and other
animals. This fear is inherited from our ancestors through genes, and at
the core of these genes are fragments carrying information, similar to
programs in phones and computers.</p>
<p>Some netizens asked why, since the aliens have such advanced medical
capabilities, they didnt cure my diabetes and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Its been 39 years since I returned from the alien planet. Although
they possess Artificial Field and Information Field Scanning
technologies for healing, it shows that their people also get sick. They
could have treated me at the time, but I wasnt ill then, and they
couldnt ensure I would remain healthy for over 39 years.</p>
<p>In recent years, my daughter has been diagnosed with schizophrenia,
and my wife has been incessantly arguing and verbally abusing me at
home. Under her immense pressure, I often find myself overworking at
construction sites and factories, doing welding and installation work,
which has become routine.</p>
<p>My illness may be due to the combination of long-term physical
overwork and mental stress. From the age of 19 to my 50s, my physical
strength was far beyond that of an average person.</p>
<p>Additionally, the frustration from the lack of progress in promoting
alien technology might also be a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Some netizens have asked how I acquired alien technology and whether
they gave me lessons.</p>
<p>They did not teach me in formal lessons, they dont have teachers or
schools. They could use Artificial Field Scanning technology to rapidly
input rote-learned knowledge into a persons brain.</p>
<p>They could also quickly extract thought and consciousness information
from a brain.</p>
<p>I can confidently say that I didnt acquire their scientific and
technological knowledge through formal instruction, although we did have
discussions about their scientific technologies.</p>
<p>They often scanned my brain with their field scanning equipment. It
was highly likely that they used this technology to input knowledge into
my brain. Another possibility is that they used it to transfer some
alien memories into my brain.</p>
<p>I remember them saying,</p>
<p>“The knowledge we put in your brain will only appear when you need
it, and then it will form a memory. Before you need it, you wont know
about it. This is to protect your brain. If all the knowledge we input
suddenly appeared in your brain, it could severely damage your brain and
lead to mental disorders”.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have experienced extreme mental anguish but have
not gone insane. Could my daughters schizophrenia be related to
this?</p>
<p>Some netizens say that I learned this knowledge or plagiarized
it.</p>
<p>But first, there has to be a condition: such knowledge must exist on
our Earth for me to learn or plagiarize it.</p>
<p>By searching for “Zhang Xiangqian” on Baidu, you can find numerous
articles I have written about Unified Field Theory, the secrets of the
universes core, and especially about the nature of time, space, fields,
charge, mass, force, energy, the speed of light, gravitational fields,
electromagnetic fields, etc. These unique perspectives are unparalleled
worldwide; how could they have been learned? If this knowledge didnt
exist before, from whom could I have learned or plagiarized it?</p>
<p>If I independently thought of the nature of time, space, fields,
charge, mass, force, energy, the speed of light, gravitational fields,
electromagnetic fields, etc., how could such profound issues, which
billions of people over thousands of years have failed to clarify, be so
easily solved by a middle school-educated farmer?</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-i-write-a-real-memoir-of-my-travel-to-the-alien">Why
dont I write a real memoir of my travel to the alien</h2>
<pre><code>planet?</code></pre>
<p>In the summer of 1985 [I was born in 1967, so I was 19 years old
then, in the prime of my life], I traveled to a highly advanced alien
planet for a month.</p>
<p>Shocked and stimulated by this experience, I returned and desperately
tried to report it to the relevant authorities, but unfortunately, no
one paid attention. Due to long-term letter writing, my right middle
finger was even deformed. During this period, I invented an
easy-to-write new type of fountain pen and even applied for a
patent.</p>
<p>When the internet reached rural areas, I started promoting my
experiences online. Sadly, 37 years have passed, and it still has not
received societal attention.</p>
<p>Many netizens have suggested to me: “Zhang Xiangqian, why dont you
write a memoir of your trip to the alien planet? If it becomes
sensational and more people pay attention to you, your alien technology
might be taken seriously by society”.</p>
<p>I have indeed thought about this. However, my early efforts were
unsuccessful. I wrote a part of it a long time ago.</p>
<p>A few years back, I wrote <em>Adventures on Planet Guoker</em>,
sometimes also titled <em>An Anhui Farmers One-month Extraterrestrial
Encounters</em>, which recounts my one-month journey on the alien
planet. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to publish it online and
reach readers.</p>
<p>Even when I managed to get it online, it was soon deleted. During
this time, I also received warning calls from relevant authorities,
asking me to write the article as a science fiction novel instead of a
factual report to avoid causing unnecessary public panic.</p>
<p>I had to repeatedly revise my article to make it resemble a science
fiction novel. This process went on for several years, and the final
version was barely recognizable from the original. I managed to publish
it online, but now its hardly found, almost all versions have been
deleted.</p>
<p>At the time, I shared my one-month experience on the alien planet for
free with any netizens who were interested. I hadnt thought about
charging for it and posted it on several websites.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, even though it was free, someone reported me, leading
to police intervention. When the police came to my house, my
mother-in-law was so scared she cried. My wife was even more furious,
vehemently scolding me for posting such nonsensical and disorganized
content online.</p>
<p>The police checked my computer and phone. Fearing further visits and
searches by the police, I later deleted the data from my USB drive.</p>
<p>Although I kept quiet for a while, I remained determined to share my
one-month experience on the alien planet online.</p>
<p>In recent years, as WeChat became popular, many of my WeChat friends
asked me to share my one-month experiences on the alien planet. So, I
shared <em>Adventures on Planet Guoker</em> with them through
WeChat.</p>
<p>When netizens asked me how much of <em>Adventures on Planet
Guoker</em> was real, I replied that about half of it was true. Many
were dissatisfied with this and asked why I didnt write a genuine memoir
of my trip to the alien planet.</p>
<p>The main reason is that my memory is fuzzy, and a true memoir would
involve a lot of sexual experimentation, which would be deleted if
published online and thus unable to reach readers. Our society clearly
cannot tolerate this. Even sharing it on WeChat was deemed a violation,
resulting in my account being blocked multiple times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sexual experiments conducted on me on the alien
planet were humiliating and abusive. Deep down, I am reluctant to speak
about these matters. My only wish is for everyone to pay attention to
the alien technology I have introduced, as it holds significant benefits
for humanity.</p>
<p>However, Ive found that in my years of promoting alien technology,
people are more interested in the sexual aspects of aliens than their
technology. Sometimes, to draw attention, I have had to mention the
sexual aspects related to aliens.</p>
<p>When I traveled to the alien planet at 19, my memory might have been
interfered with by the aliens. What I remember is not very clear; its
fragmented, and the chronological order of the events I experienced is
scrambled, leaving me unsure of which events occurred first and which
came later. This disruption in the sequence of events confuses my
memory, making it challenging to clearly articulate some aspects.</p>
<p>Its not like traveling on Earth, where you can narrate the journey
step by step.</p>
<p>Additionally, their society is highly virtualized, making it hard to
distinguish what parts were virtual and what parts were real life. They
use a frequency-cutting technique that makes you feel like youre
traveling and interacting with others while lying in bed, almost
indistinguishable from a real journey or interaction.</p>
<p>Their way of traveling involves using a global movement network to go
directly from home to the destination in an instant, regardless of
distance. This is unlike our way of leaving through a door and traveling
by car, train, or plane.</p>
<p>Moreover, they have many different spacetime zones; in some places,
time moves quickly, while in others, it moves slowly.</p>
<p>When several of them gather, they use a technique that allows some
people to see you while making you invisible to others.</p>
<p>Their world is highly virtualized, giving a dreamlike and bizarre
sensation. Their planet is also extremely licentious, mainly because
their people do not adhere to moral principles or laws, which have a
very limited scope there. Many of their behaviors would be unimaginable
and unacceptable on Earth.</p>
<p>I suspect they took me for two reasons: to study information about my
past life left in space and to acquire information about my body and
physical movements.</p>
<p>After my encounter with the aliens was made public online, it drew
the attention of many people. Baoshan TV in Shanghai interviewed me, but
unfortunately, the program did not pass the review and was not broadcast
on television.</p>
<p><em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em> although not entirely true,
reveals many details about alien life previously unknown. Within the
bounds of what our current society can barely tolerate, it satisfies the
publics curiosity about the real life of aliens and their planet, while
also offering insights and references for researchers.</p>
<p>Recently, netizens privately messaged me, wanting to see the
electronic version of Adventures <em>on the Planet Guoker,</em> and
proposed paying for it. Some other netizens were unhappy and criticized
me harshly for this.</p>
<p>Lately, Ive been suffering from tuberculosis and diabetes, which has
prevented me from doing heavy labor like wielding a hammer and welding,
my main source of income. My earnings have drastically reduced, and my
application for social welfare was unsuccessful. Im now considering
writing as a means of livelihood and hope for understanding from
netizens.</p>
<p>A while back, our area experienced a flood, and we were busy moving
out and then back in. When I have time, I still intend to write a true
account of my one-month journey on the alien planet.</p>
<p>For a long time, I hesitated to write because it was impossible to
publish online. I thought of sending it via WeChat File Transfer to
interested netizens, but this often resulted in my WeChat being
blocked.</p>
<p>Recently, Ive found that sending it through my email is safer, so Ive
been encouraged to write the real version again.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-acquire-the-alien-technologies">How did I acquire the
alien technologies?</h2>
<p>An netizen asked me how the aliens imparted their scientific
knowledge to me.</p>
<p>They have a technology called Artificial Field Scanning that can
transmit knowledge and other information into the human brain using an
intangible field. It can also scan a persons brain to extract their
thoughts and consciousness.</p>
<p>During my stay on their planet, I underwent numerous experiments,
many of which involved scanning my brain with their equipment.</p>
<p>Sometimes, while being scanned, I also received their instructions on
how to think and recall.</p>
<p>I suspect that the way I acquired their scientific knowledge was most
likely through their use of Artificial Field Scanning technology, which
transferred their knowledge directly into my brain. It wasnt obtained
through verbal communication. In just one month, it would be impossible
to learn, master, and assimilate so much scientific and technological
information through verbal communication.</p>
<p>I recall them saying that the knowledge they transferred to my brain
would only come to mind when I needed to use it. Otherwise, I wouldnt
remember it spontaneously.</p>
<p>If this knowledge suddenly appeared all at once in my mind, it could
cause brain damage and lead to symptoms like schizophrenia.</p>
<p>For several decades, I have experienced unexplained mental tension
and pain. Whether this is related to the alien encounters, I cant be
sure. I have never shown symptoms of schizophrenia, but my daughter has
developed the condition. Could there be a connection?</p>
<p>Its also possible that they transferred part of an aliens memory into
my brain, so I possess some memories and knowledge of an alien.</p>
<p>They communicated with me verbally too. I was curious about their
bodies, sex, and relationships, and when I asked them about it, they
either ignored me or gave brief, dismissive answers.</p>
<p>They repeatedly instilled this concept in me, emphasizing that it is
the most crucial secret of the universe, only accessible to beings from
highly civilized and advanced planets. This principle must be of utmost
importance.</p>
<p>Analyze, if this principle is correct, then our earthly concepts of
dark matter, dark energy, string theory, the God particle, and the
standard model would all be fundamentally incorrect and utterly
useless.</p>
<p>From this principle, we realize that time, fields, mass, charge, the
speed of light, momentum, force, and energy – all of these are effects
of the movement of matter in space or the relative movement of space
around matter, and that space itself is constantly in motion.</p>
<p>Many netizens comment that my memoir of the journey to the alien
planet and the alien scientific theories are eye-opening but also
logically disorganized and chaotic.</p>
<p>One reason for this could be my junior high school education level,
which limits my ability to clearly explain complex alien scientific
theories.</p>
<p>Another reason is the unusual manner in which I acquired alien
technology. Currently, I cant distinguish between what I learned through
communication with the aliens, what was transmitted to my brain through
their field scanning, what memories I have from an alien, and what I
learned by accessing information in space.</p>
<p>Regarding my account of the journey to the alien planet in Adventures
on the Planet Guoker, an netizen asked if it was real. I can only say
that about half of it is true. This is because my memory is blurry and I
cannot clearly differentiate which experiences happened first and which
occurred later. I suspect this confusion may be due to the aliens
interfering with my memory.</p>
<p>There have been reports suggesting that aliens can disrupt and modify
the memories of Earthlings they contact. They can jumble the sequence of
events or alter memories to make them seem absurd, leading to ridicule
and doubt when the contactees try to describe their experiences.</p>
<p>I have faced similar situations. There are things I hesitate to talk
about for fear of being ridiculed for their absurdity.</p>
<p>Also, its reported that aliens abduct Earthlings for various sexual
experimentation activities, collecting data from these acts. However,
due to the sensitive nature of these topics, they are difficult to
discuss openly.</p>
<p>Additionally, societal norms make it challenging to accept
discussions about alien activities.</p>
<p>When I initially wrote Adventures on the Planet Guoker, I struggled
to get it published online. After receiving warning calls, I had to
repeatedly revise it to resemble a science fiction novel before it was
finally published online, where it has mostly been deleted now.</p>
<p>An netizen told me, “If you had just written about physics or
technology and not mentioned aliens, your situation might have been
better today, and you could have received more help. By bringing up
aliens, you created aversion, which is detrimental to your promotion of
advanced technology”.</p>
<p>When I returned from the alien planet, I actively promoted my
encounter with aliens. Discussing aliens might have caused aversion in
others, which I didnt fully consider at the time, nor did I anticipate
that I would now face severe online censorship.</p>
<p>I want to clarify that when I went to various institutions to promote
alien technology, even before mentioning aliens, I was told to leave,
perhaps due to my appearance. It wasnt because I spoke of aliens that
people thought my stories were fanciful.</p>
<h2 id="made-takeout-food-in-hefei-anhui">Made takeout food in Hefei,
Anhui</h2>
<p>Originally, I ran a small shop in my rural hometown, did some
welding, and repaired bicycles. After being relocated due to
demolitions, I moved to the nearby town of Tongda to continue my
business. Little did I know that this place was a newly developed “ghost
town” with hardly any pedestrians on the streets, which meant the
business was poor.</p>
<p>My daughter and son-in-law were running a snack and delivery service
in Hefei. Later on, my wife went to join them, and together they
franchised a Liangji Burrito King in Hefei. They asked me to come to
Hefei to help them out.</p>
<p>One of their stores was located on the North First Ring, and the
other was near Mingjiao Temple on a pedestrian street.</p>
<p>The so-called stores on the pedestrian street were just shelters with
a roof for rain protection, with no walls surrounding them. A single
electrical wire hung from above to power the small 1.5 by 0.8 meters
area, which costs 10,000 yuan in rent per month. Electricity was 1.6
yuan per kWh, and the water bill was not small either, with everyone
sharing the cost. The landlord was a mystery, someone deep and
impenetrable.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/WkyglNKY8iPELUV.png" width="485" height="540"></p>
<p>Every night, my wife and others had to carry the snack-making
equipment back to their rental home, which was more than ten miles away,
and bring it back in the morning, which was very troublesome. My wife
called many times, asking me to come to Hefei to weld a cabinet for them
so that they could lock up their equipment and wouldnt have to carry it
back and forth.</p>
<p>I have severe motion sickness and didnt want to go to Hefei. Its
crowded on the pedestrian street, and only after 1 a.m., when the
neighbors closed up, could I do any welding work. So, with no welders to
be found, I reluctantly brought a welding machine and went there.</p>
<p>My wife and the others set up their stall at 9 a.m. and didnt close
until midnight. After returning to their rented home, they had to cook
and do laundry, often not getting to sleep until 1 a.m., which was
incredibly tough.</p>
<p>My wife repeatedly asked me to shut down my welding operation in
Tongda and join them in making burritos, working both the store and
delivery. Knowing that I disliked staying up late, and fully aware of my
wifes and daughters formidable nature, I knew they would take their
frustrations out on me over any small issue, so I never agreed.</p>
<p>Their skill in making burritos was astonishingly fast, absolutely
jaw-dropping. Rolling the dough, adding vegetables, wrapping the
burrito, and packaging it was done in one smooth sequence, the action is
dazzling. Since the stall rent was so expensive and each burrito only
cost a few yuan, only those with fast hands could survive.</p>
<p>Sometimes the store is not only crowded with customers, but also
delivery riders come rushing, creating immense psychological
pressure.</p>
<p>After just a few days, I witnessed two snack stall owners give up
because they were operating at a loss. Some stall owners didn’t even
make enough to cover their stall rent, spending their days in sighs and
groans.</p>
<p>I struck up a conversation with one of the stall owners and asked,
“Why is the rent here so expensive? Who is the landlord?”</p>
<p>The stall owner first cursed the landlord for being greedy, but then
defended him, saying, “The landlord is someone from Zhengzhou. All of us
here curse him for his greed, but you have to think about it too. For
the landlord to acquire this location and develop these stalls, he must
have had to pay a fortune to some mysterious figures. Those mysterious
figures are the ones at the top of the food chain!”</p>
<p>There was one person selling stinky tofu who used a powerful fan to
blow the smell onto the street, and had a TV continuously playing a
program where they were interviewed by a TV station. It was very noisy,
but their business was booming. On a good day, they could make over ten
thousand yuan, a real miracle. However, such miracles were a rarity.
Most of the stall owners were operating at a loss.</p>
<p>As a result, the ownership of these stalls frequently changed hands.
As some stall owners put it, “The dead aren’t carried out before the
living come squeezing in”.</p>
<p>There was a couple from Wuhu who rented a one-square-meter stall for
12,000 yuan a month, paying a years rent in advance. They sold something
called Taiwanese herbal jelly, but had no business. They often sat in
silence, staring blankly, as if pondering the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Someone sold roasted pig trotters, and initially, the business was a
hit, but later it died down. When I inquired about it, a girl said that
at first, everyone was curious and tried the pig trotters, but now that
they knew the taste, the interest waned. “Who can eat pig trotters every
day? The stomach can’t handle it”.</p>
<p>There were three young men selling grilled squid, playing music very
loudly. The space was so small that only one person could fit inside to
do the grilling. The young man grilling the squid moved as if he was
performing an intense dance, attracting many girls who took photos with
their phones.</p>
<p>After a while, another would take his place, and the one who was
replaced would sit exhausted against the opposite wall, panting like a
dog after a mad dash. When called upon, he would not say anything, only
gesturing with his hand. If you asked him again, he would ignore you,
remaining silent like a wooden figure.</p>
<p>Once I drove an electric tricycle from Tongda Town to the Hefei
Pedestrian Street. Along the way, relatives gave me a lot of
strawberries. My wife gave many of them to two sisters who sell Wuhan
bullfrogs in our neighborhood. At that time, strawberries were quite
expensive, and I chided my wife for being too generous. However, to my
surprise, those sisters later gave us a lot of grilled bullfrogs to
eat.</p>
<p>Every time I visited, the stinky tofu auntie would serve me plenty of
stinky tofu, which made me think my wife must have often given them her
spring rolls to eat. The snack stall owners on the pedestrian street had
good relationships with one another, often sharing their delicacies.
Many of the vendors were operating at a loss, and the only good
impression of the pedestrian street was this sense of community.</p>
<p>Once, there was a long queue on the pedestrian street as many people
were lining up to buy something. My wife and the others told me to queue
up as well, but it was too crowded, so I turned back. They were
persistent and sent a simple-minded fellow to buy instead. He brought
the items back amidst much fuss, but when we saw what he had bought, we
were deeply disappointed—it turned out to be some kind of hand-torn
bread on discount as part of a promotion.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/NQnk9mj7uKTMaci.png" width="473" height="527"></p>
<p>After midnight, at 12 oclock, a metal barrier would open, and
suddenly, many people in thick cotton coats, riding electric tricycles,
would swiftly enter the pedestrian street. It was a magnificent scene,
resembling a battle from a movie. It turned out that these people were
night market vendors allowed to set up stalls until 5 a.m.</p>
<p>Their actions were very quick, as soon as the tricycle stopped, the
vendor would open the box at the back, which transformed into a shelf.
In the blink of an eye, as if by magic, the stall was ready.</p>
<p>Beggars here had a high income, possibly making a hundred yuan an
hour, but management was strict. If special duty officers found them,
they were immediately shooed away.</p>
<p>If a snack stall owner left their goods by the roadside and the
special duty officers saw it, they would first give a warning. If it
wasnt moved, the goods would be confiscated immediately, with no room
for negotiation.</p>
<p>Later on, perhaps due to the economic downturn, both my wife and
daughter were running at a loss in their shops located at the North
First Ring of Hefei and Huaihe Road Pedestrian Street. To cut costs, I
had to return to Tongda Town to continue running the repair shop,
occasionally going to Hefei to help them.</p>
<p>My son-in-law worked at the bank and would help out after work in the
evenings. My daughter took care of the North First Ring shop by herself,
and my wife looked after the Pedestrian Street shop on her own.</p>
<p>Once, my wife called to say the battery of their electric tricycle
had been stolen by a thief. Since they didn’t have a welded anti-theft
device, this was already the fourth theft this year. She suffers from
severe motion sickness, so she had no choice but to walk more than 20
miles daily from her residence to Huaihe Road. At midnight, she had to
walk back to her home in the Lingquan Road Lingyu Garden, which was
incredibly arduous and unbearable.</p>
<p>Theft in Hefei has become rampant, severely affecting the daily lives
of the residents. The snack vendors on Huaihe Road Pedestrian Street
said that each of them had had their electric vehicles and batteries
stolen.</p>
<p>Since I also had severe motion sickness, I had no choice but to drive
the electric tricycle, and it took nearly 3 hours to travel from Tongda
Town in Lujiang County to Hefei.</p>
<p>However, once I arrived in Hefei, my wife’s electric tricycle was
stolen again, rendering the battery I brought useless. They demanded to
use my electric tricycle daily for transport, but I wanted to return to
Tongda Town to continue my welding work. They absolutely refuse to
agree.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/5d32vQybztWwOmi.png" width="427" height="296"></p>
<p>But now, their snack stalls are not even making as much as the daily
rent; they are essentially working for the landlord for free. My wife
packs up her stall at midnight every day and after cooking and cleaning,
it’s 1 a.m. before she can sleep. This kind of business is simply
torture.</p>
<p>I have advised them to close the two snack stalls and do something
else, but they say the rent has been paid and is non-refundable. Even
trying to sublet the place now is very difficult.</p>
<p>I said, when the lease is up, you should do something else, start a
different business or get a job.</p>
<p>My wife and the others didn’t make their stance clear, but she said
that no matter how desperate the situation becomes, they will not return
with me to live in the rural area of Tongda.</p>
<p>I find it hard to understand them. They work incredibly hard every
day, lose money, spend their days making spring rolls at the stall,
dodge the surging traffic on the roads, and they have no leisure time to
enjoy themselves, no reprieve from the polluted air and the harsh noise.
Whats the point of living like this in a big city?</p>
<p>Once, my daughter said she wanted to eat buns. The bun shop was just
across from the North First Ring Road, but crossing the road felt like
an arduous task amidst the flood of traffic. Life in the big city was
very awkward.</p>
<p>This trip left me with a bad impression of Hefei. Many people came
over enthusiastically to greet me, but the stall owners on the
pedestrian street told me they were all scammers.</p>
<p>On the pedestrian street, I saw a very young boy forcibly handing
flowers to a young couple and then demanding tens of yuan. A young man
casually gave him 10 yuan, but the flower boy said it wasnt enough.
Clinging onto the couples clothes, he refused to let go. Such a young
child had learned to extort, showing such incredibly poor character.
What is happening to our society?</p>
<p>At the intersection of Mengcheng Road and North First Ring, I saw a
person wrapped in white cloth, lying rigidly with a woman beside him
wailing loudly, saying her man had died and they had no money for his
burial, hoping for charitable donations from the public.</p>
<p>I was a bit shocked, but my wife and daughter disdainfully said it
was fake, that they were acting to scam money. They had done it many
times in other parts of Hefei, and it no longer surprised them.</p>
<p>I stayed in Hefei for a while and suggested to my wife to expand the
variety of her spring rolls, lower the prices a bit, add some new
twists, and improve the taste, hoping to enhance the business. But my
wife and the others completely ignored my advice and instead turned
against me, accusing me of being incompetent, unable to make money, and
causing their hardship.</p>
<p>Later, against their vehement opposition, I forcefully returned to
Tongda Town.</p>
<p>I find it hard to understand their mentality; it seemed like they
were driven by a stubborn, unyielding spirit. But if no one in a family
earns money, how can they live in the future?</p>
<p>After I left, due to severe losses, my wife had to close her shop on
the pedestrian street, and my daughter had to shut down her shop on the
North First Ring. They called me to help them move.</p>
<p>Once, while moving late into the night, we were exhausted to the
bone. Many of the snack-making equipment couldnt even be given away in
the city center. The landlord said that since a contract had been
signed, we had to move everything out before dawn, no matter what.</p>
<p>We desperately hoped for a waste collector to appear. The equipment,
bought for over 80,000 yuan, was now set to be given away for nothing,
but in the city center, there were no waste collectors with large enough
vehicles. We had no choice but to grit our teeth and move it
ourselves.</p>
<p>My son-in-law and I took the snack-making equipment to a bamboo grove
in a residential area, hiding much of it under the watchful eyes of the
security guards. Once, when a guard approached and was about to discover
us, I purposefully engaged him in conversation, drawing his attention
away by asking, “Let me ask you something, that place over there…” and I
led the guard away.</p>
<p>Later, I slowly transported the equipment back to our rural family
home in Guohe Town, Lujiang County, using an electric tricycle, load by
load. The entire moving process was as exhausting as a nightmare.</p>
<p>However, my daughter and wife still hadnt given up; they still wanted
to run a snack and delivery business. In 2017, behind my back, they
opened a porridge shop on the side of East Second Ring Road in Hefei.
Under their strict orders, I had no choice but to transport the food
preparation equipment from our rural home in Guohe Town, Lujiang County,
to Hefeis East Second Ring using the electric tricycle. It took about a
dozen trips and roughly a month to move all the equipment and household
goods, and to get everything like water, electricity, and shelves
installed.</p>
<p>The porridge shop on the East Second Ring had few walk-in customers,
so we could only sell online and solely offer delivery.</p>
<p>Due to fierce competition, they operated 24 hours a day, often
staying up all night and working at high intensity and a fast pace.</p>
<p>I asked them, “Why keep the business running 24 hours non-stop? Cant
you rest for a few hours at night?”</p>
<p>They replied, “The money we make during the day and evening just
covers the rent, electricity, water, and other expenses. The real
earnings come from the money we make at night.”</p>
<p>This online delivery required quick meal preparation; once an order
came in, it had to be ready within minutes. Sometimes during meal times,
orders would come in one after another, and delivery riders from Meituan
and Ele.me would press us hard, which led to extreme mental stress.</p>
<p>A few days ago, they called me and said they needed to boost orders
by significantly cutting prices for a while, to expand our influence and
secure more orders in the future. This is a common tactic used when the
delivery business is struggling or just starting.</p>
<p>Because the promotional sale increased order volumes and they were
overwhelmed, they asked me to come and help.</p>
<p>I rode the electric tricycle from Tongda Town, Lujiang, to Hefei, and
immediately started working in my daughters porridge shop.</p>
<p>We worked during the day and the first half of the night; my
son-in-law took the second half. At night, as soon as I lay down, my
wife would yell, “Theres an order!” making it impossible for me to
sleep, and I would yawn all day long. During the day, I would drive the
electric tricycle to the market to get supplies, often dozing off while
driving. Frightened, I had to briefly close my eyes and then forcefully
command myself to keep them open.</p>
<p>At night, my wife expressed her unhappiness about running the store
with our daughter. She was scolded by our daughter like a child, and the
days were unbearable. By the end of the year, she didnt even want to
work anymore. Our daughter often verbally abused her and hit her a few
days ago. My wife showed me the bruises on her body, which left me
feeling very heavy-hearted.</p>
<p>The next evening, I said to my daughter, “Why do you berate and hit
your mother? She doesnt want to work until the end of the year anymore.
But if we leave, what will happen to this store?”</p>
<p>To my surprise, my daughter reacted angrily to my words. She didnt
reflect on her behavior at all; instead, she blamed her mother and me,
telling me to get lost and immediately go back to Tongda Town. I said,
“Its already dark now, and its very cold at night in winter. How can I
endure the ride on the electric tricycle?”</p>
<p>“Are you leaving or not?” my daughter demanded, picking up something
and smashing it forcefully on the wooden floor as if she were about to
become violent. I had to drive away on the tricycle, only to be caught
up by my wife, who said, “Its too cold at night, and with our daughter
blocking the staircase, I didnt dare to get your clothes.” My wife told
me to stay on the street and not to go anywhere, waiting for my
son-in-law to come back.</p>
<p>More than two hours later, my son-in-law returned and called me
back.</p>
<p>That night, my wife wept bitterly, almost the whole night, and was
adamant about returning to our old home in Tongda.</p>
<p>The next day, my wife and I started moving our things, preparing to
go back to Tongda Town. My son-in-law begged desperately, “Normally, the
store needs three people. Its very busy with just two. If you both
leave, she [referring to my daughter] wont be able to manage alone and
will have to close the store. We have been boosting orders and laying
the foundation until now, just as the order volume was increasing and we
were about to make a profit. If you leave, wouldnt all our hard work be
in vain? Moreover, we have invested so much in this store; we really
cant afford to take such a loss...”</p>
<p>My son-in-law worked at a bank and faced the immense pressure of a
mortgage. He didnt dare quit his job to go into the delivery business
because its very unstable.</p>
<p>My wife said, “But staying here for one day feels more torturous than
an entire year. She curses at me for no reason; its like shes abusing
me.”</p>
<p>I said, “Were also very torn and conflicted inside. If we dont help
manage the store, it can only close down, and we simply cant afford that
loss. But staying here is excruciating. She keeps telling me to go away,
and she even hit me last time. We are really in a difficult position;
even the smartest person would be at a loss in this situation.”</p>
<p>Our daughter had once suffered from schizophrenia. Fearing that the
porridge shops closure would trigger her mental disturbance. In the end,
we decided to stay despite our deep internal conflicts and
hesitations</p>
<p>Last time, I rushed from Tongda Town in Lujiang to Hefei on an
electric tricycle. For some reason, my daughter cursed at me and told me
to go home. I said the tricycle was charging and I would leave once it
was charged. She insisted that I leave right then. I didnt agree, and
suddenly she punched me in the head and scratched my face with her
nails.</p>
<p>Sitting there, feeling extremely despondent, I did not react to being
struck multiple times by my daughter until she lifted a large teacup.
Thats when I dodged and, having no other choice, I had to take refuge at
a relatives house on my electric tricycle. When I left, I could hear my
wife still calling out to my daughter to take orders. Poor wife, she
probably didnt realize that our daughter was having an episode.</p>
<p>Our daughter is sick, and under the pressure of the mortgage, my
wife, son-in-law, and daughter cant afford to think of much else but
earning money.</p>
<p>In 2015, while working in Hefei, our daughter developed schizophrenia
but got better after active treatment. Over the years, she found a
boyfriend in Hefei, and last year they got married against our advice.
She strongly insisted on buying a house in Hefei, and eventually, they
got a mortgage. But my daughter constantly frets over the monthly
mortgage payments of four or five thousand yuan.</p>
<p>The following year they had a baby. During childbirth, my daughter
had a relapse. She caused an uproar at home, turning everything upside
down, disrupting the peace and bringing immense pain and fear to the
family.</p>
<p>Later, we admitted our daughter to the Hefei Fourth Hospital, where
she was placed in a secure ward. The hospital did not allow family
visits. My wife, longing to see our daughter, was denied by the nurse
unequivocally. Overcome by her emotions, my wife collapsed and fainted
from crying.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend used to run a snack business, and my wife was very much
in favor of our family starting a snack business in Hefei. However, this
line of work proved challenging, and over the years, my wife, daughter,
and son-in-law faced repeated failures. Now, the son-in-law has taken up
a job at a bank.</p>
<p>They had set up shops on the North First Ring of Hefei on the Hefei
Pedestrian Street, but both failed. When setting up the shops, they had
me move things with the electric tricycle. When the shops closed down, I
had to move their belongings with the tricycle, back and forth, to the
point of exhaustion.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/NlXa8wIn7zODbJL.png" width="532" height="232"></p>
<p>Our daughter is beautiful, intelligent, and strong-willed; she was
determined to make a name for herself in the big city of Hefei. Yet, now
we face this outcome. The pace of life in the big city is fast, the
pressure intense, and many living there arent truly happy. People
shouldnt force themselves to do what they cannot, that is my advice.
Ordinary people without a solid economic foundation are dragged down by
the weight of buying a house in the big city.</p>
<p>Her current temper might also be an aftereffect of schizophrenia, or
it could be her inherent nature; we are not sure. When I was a child, my
father was too strict with me, so I wanted to be more lenient with my
child. Thus, I never laid a hand on my daughter, which perhaps led to
her being spoiled and developing a capricious and obstinate character,
often termed princess syndrome.</p>
<p>I wasnt in Tongda Town for long when my daughter called me from
Hefei, crying that her phone had been stolen. Then my wife called,
saying that our daughter was shaking and breaking out in cold sweats
upon losing her phone. I had a bad feeling about this because my
daughter had previously suffered from schizophrenia, and I feared she
might relapse from the stimulation.</p>
<p>I immediately rushed from Tongda Town in Lujiang to Hefei on my
electric tricycle. It was evident that something was off with my
daughter; she hurled abusive words at me. Yesterday, as I lay in bed
upstairs trying to sleep, she came in and told me to go home. I told her
the tricycle battery was charging and I would leave once it was charged.
She insisted I had to leave right then. I didnt agree, and she suddenly
punched me in the head and scratched my face.</p>
<p>Over these past few years, we have been constantly worried about our
daughters illness relapsing. Our daughter often picks quarrels and
argues with us for no reason. When shes upset, my wife takes it out on
me, verbally abusing me without cause. Once, we were so busy that we
hadnt eaten anything by noon. Feeling extremely hungry, I saw some
leftover porridge in the pot and wanted to eat some to tide me over. But
my wife scolded me for my unseemly eating habits and even poured dirty
water into the pot.</p>
<p>There was an incident when my daughter wouldnt let her mother call my
son-in-law; she tried to take her mothers phone away. When her mother
wouldnt let go, my daughter actually bit her mothers phone until it was
ruined.</p>
<p>Angered, her mother slapped her, and my daughter retaliated by
picking up a large iron ladle to smash her mothers head. Fortunately,
her mother dodged it. Watching this, my legs trembled.</p>
<p>It seems we must leave our daughters porridge shop; if we stay, it
might cost someone their life.</p>
<p>My wife called her nephew, who came by car to take her to a relatives
house.</p>
<p>As I got terribly motion sickness and had come to Hefei on an
electric tricycle, I had no choice but to leave my daughters porridge
shop on it.</p>
<p>As I was leaving, my daughter pitifully said, “Dad, are you and mom
really leaving? I cant run the shop by myself, what should I do?”</p>
<p>Tears instantly welled up in my eyes. “My daughter, we came here to
help, but with your frequent quarrels and violence, how can we
stay?”</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/XvGkJHfRlZBWSDY.png" width="496" height="383"></p>
<p>Riding the electric tricycle to Baohedadao, it had gotten dark, and
without a canopy on my tricycle, I was caught in a blizzard, soaking wet
and frozen to the core, my hands numb with cold. Fortunately, my nephew
had bought me a bicycle raincoat that shielded the front of my chest
from the rain and snow.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Mulan path of Feixi, the oncoming cars passed, and
I was blinded, seeing nothing. My tricycle had no lights, and fearing I
might tumble into a ditch, I was terrified and could only drive the
tricycle slowly.</p>
<p>Around 8 in the evening, I returned to Tongda Town.</p>
<p>Not long after we left, our daughter had no choice but to close her
congee shop on the East Second Ring. My son-in-law used a large truck to
move the shops equipment to our old rural home in Guohe Town. And with
that, our dreams of running a takeout and snack business came to an
abrupt end.</p>
<p>I felt a sense of relief, yet I sensed that my wife might actually
enjoy this line of work, perhaps out of an unwillingness to admit
defeat, she couldn’t stop thinking about it. Last year, around December
(2016 or 2017), she went to help out at a relative’s congee takeout shop
in Hefei for a while. Several of her relatives in Hefei were involved in
the takeout business.</p>
<p>After she returned, my wife complained to me, saying that her
relatives in Hefei make 500,000 yuan a year from takeout, and she blamed
me for not joining them in their dedicated efforts.</p>
<p>I replied, “I’ve never wanted to be involved in the takeout business.
It’s only a minority who make money from it. When people open their
phones, they see thousands of takeout options, but everyone only looks
at the first 8 or 9 recommended on the first page. How many are willing
to scroll further? Moreover, with no barriers to entry, the competition
in takeout is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Your relative always appears first on the phone, their family of 5 or
6 people, working in perfect harmony, never arguing, working 24 hours a
day without rest, never closing even during the Spring Festival,
occasionally running promotions at a loss for a while. They’ve also
worked desperately to get where they are; the money they’ve earned has
come from hard work.”</p>
<p>Later, my wife told me that her relative’s daughter-in-law, due to
long-term immense pressure, had developed schizophrenia and had just
been admitted to The Fourth Peoples Hospital.</p>
<p>Previously, the wife from the Wukong Fried Rice takeout next door had
trouble lighting the high-powered stove. When the gas accumulated too
much and finally ignited, it exploded with a bang, burning her face and
chest, and the immediate medical treatment cost tens of thousands of
yuan.</p>
<p>Once, while my wife and daughter were in the shop, the high-powered
stove backfired, setting the gas hose on fire. I was so scared that my
legs went weak.</p>
<h2 id="contracted-tuberculosis-in-2018">Contracted tuberculosis in
2018</h2>
<p>In 2018, there was a period when I kept coughing. When I went to
Tongda Town Hospital for treatment, it immediately got better, but I
would get tired quickly whenever I worked. One day, I was so exhausted
that I could hardly walk. Once, I coughed up blood, which worried me a
lot. I suspected lung cancer, though I had been vaccinated with the BCG
vaccine, so I thought it unlikely to be tuberculosis, even though
tuberculosis can also cause coughing up blood.</p>
<p>I wanted to go to the hospital for a check-up but was afraid of
finding lung cancer written on the report, so I always hesitated to get
tested.</p>
<p>However, one night I had a severe fever, and my wife, after feeling
my body, said something was wrong. The next day, I postponed all my
welding work and went to Tongda Hospital for a check-up.</p>
<p>The doctor asked me to stay while everyone else left, and I had a bad
feeling. Pointing at the X-ray, the doctor said it was severe
tuberculosis and that I needed to go to Lujiang for treatment.</p>
<p>I stayed in Lujiang Peoples Hospital for 14 days. After being
discharged, the doctor prescribed many medications for me to take at
home.</p>
<p>Spending 14 days in the hospital felt like years, and I was very
anxious.</p>
<p>When the doctor asked about my job, I said I was a welder.</p>
<p>The doctor told me that welding fumes are toxic and harmful to the
lungs and advised me not to continue welding after returning home.
However, I worried about my livelihood without welding, as starting a
new business is tough and most people fail.</p>
<p>On the way back from the hospital, I felt heavy-hearted again.</p>
<p>My brother also had tuberculosis, which frequently reoccurred, and he
would cough up large amounts of blood, which was very frightening. He
struggled with it for decades.</p>
<p>His condition had frightened me, and despite having received the BCG
vaccine twice, I was shocked to find myself infected with tuberculosis
just after turning 50.</p>
<p>I asked my doctor, “Ive been vaccinated with BCG twice. Why did I
still get tuberculosis?”</p>
<p>“The BCG vaccine doesnt prevent lung tuberculosis; it only prevents
tuberculosis of the brain”, the doctor casually explained.</p>
<p>“Your tuberculosis might be caused by high blood sugar. High blood
sugar weakens the immune system, making one susceptible to tuberculosis.
Havent you noticed any symptoms of high blood sugar recently?”</p>
<p>“I havent noticed anything. I pay attention to my diet, dont eat
indiscriminately, and dont smoke or drink. I cant understand why my
blood sugar is high”, I replied.</p>
<p>“Did you go hungry as a child?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I often went hungry when I was young. Although the great famine
was over, we still didnt have enough food”.</p>
<p>“It might be that going hungry as a child led to genetic changes”,
the doctor said before attending to other patients.</p>
<p>After returning home from the hospital, I now take many medications
daily, including anti-tuberculosis drugs, blood sugar reducers, liver
protectants [to prevent damage from tuberculosis medications], and
supplementary treatments.</p>
<p>As a farmer, getting sick means lacking any form of security. Now
that I can no longer do welding work and earn money, the cost of daily
medication is a burden, and I often endure harsh words from my wife,
which I can only bear in silence. Back when I could earn money, I could
at least respond to her.</p>
<p>It feels like human technology is still very backward. My research on
Unified Field Theory predicts that an artificial information field could
rapidly and completely cure hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and various
infectious diseases, leading humanity into a drug-free era.
Unfortunately, in China, status matters a lot. As I come from a farming
background, these significant scientific discoveries go unrecognized,
which is truly regrettable.</p>
<h2 id="the-scene-of-encountering-the-aliens-at-home-reappeared">The
scene of encountering the aliens at home reappeared</h2>
<pre><code>vividly in my dream yesterday</code></pre>
<p>In the early summer of 1985, when I was 19 years old, I was taken by
aliens while sleeping at home and traveled to an alien planet for a
month. However, on Earth, it was only one nights duration. Their time is
different from ours. I felt as though I spent a month on their
planet.</p>
<p>Last night, I vividly re-experienced in my dream the encounter with
the aliens from 1985 [the last time, as Ive had no contact with them
since], when I was sleeping at home.</p>
<p>This morning, I immediately turned on my computer and described the
dream. My routine is to write an article for my public account in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>In the early summer of my 19th year [1985], the weather wasnt very
hot, and we hadnt set up mosquito nets yet. I was sleeping alone in the
second room from the west of the front row of houses at my family home,
while my parents slept in the first room.</p>
<p>This row of houses consists of five rooms in total, with the main
entrance in the center and houses with windows on both sides. The two
rooms adjacent to the main door, on either side, didnt have windows. I
slept in the room to the west of the main door, which had no window and
no separating wall from the main hall.</p>
<p>Especially in last nights dream, it became vividly clear that the
room where I slept had a stove on the north side, and I slept against
the wall on the south side of the room.</p>
<p>Previously in my articles, I described the house as being made of
brick and stone walls with six rooms, which I now realize was a mistake.
The house in my dream yesterday had five rooms and was made of mud
walls.</p>
<p>When the aliens took me, I went directly through the wall, not out
the main door. While passing through the wall, the earthy smell left a
profound impression on me, if it had been a stone wall, how could it
have had that earthy scent?</p>
<p>The existing six rooms made of stone and brick may have been
renovated after 1985, with an additional room added on the east side.
But in 1985, those five rooms were all made of mud walls.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/g75CNsVIq8j6e3R.jpg" width="409" height="546"></p>
<p>The house that still exists in my old home</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/SLxFwRulPqadosW.png" width="312" height="415"></p>
<p>Below is an article I previously wrote, describing the scene when I
encountered the aliens:</p>
<p>In 1985, not long after I lay down, half-asleep, I felt as if
something was hovering over the roof of my house. The familiar sensation
from my childhood of “they are coming, they are coming...” appeared
again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt the room turn bright red. Startled awake, I got up
from the bed and stood beside it. I saw a glowing liquid seeping through
the wall, emitting a dark red light mixed with some light purple. As
this liquid fully seeped into the room, it gradually formed several
human shapes.</p>
<p>These peoples bodies appeared as if composed of countless tiny red
bugs dancing together, moving swiftly and chaotically.</p>
<p>Intense fear made me tremble uncontrollably, and my hands, feet, and
throat stiffened and stopped responding to my brain.</p>
<p>These mysterious visitors didnt speak, but I seemed to hear a
standard male voice in my mind saying, “Come with us”.</p>
<p>At that moment, I was fully awake and remembered clearly that it
wasnt a dream.</p>
<p>As I was bewildered, I suddenly felt an invisible force hitting me
hard from the front, instantly taking control, especially of my head. It
felt like it was suddenly filled with liquid and sand-like substances,
creating an intense feeling of numbness and fullness.</p>
<p>My consciousness seemed to be powerfully controlled by this
mysterious force, becoming blurry, and my brains ability to think and
judge slowed down. I became less lucid, and all my sensations seemed
dulled. My body felt light and unsteady as I walked. Gradually, my
trembling stopped and my fear lessened.</p>
<p>I saw them pass through the wall, and it appeared to become
semi-transparent. I followed them through. After passing through, I
realized I was barefoot, wearing only a sweatshirt and underwear,
completely disheveled.</p>
<p>The earthy smell of the wall left a deep impression on me. Passing
through the wall felt as if every molecule of the wall uniformly moved
through my body, rather than the wall opening a crack for me to pass
through.</p>
<p>Also, when passing through the wall, every part of the body
experiences a sensation hard to describe, different from not passing
through it. It felt like countless tiny sand particles gently rubbing
inside my body, accompanied by a slightly pleasant feeling. The speed of
passing through wasnt fast, similar to a normal walking pace. As I was
about to exit the wall, my heels felt numb. Once I was out, the numbness
disappeared.</p>
<p>For decades, Ive often dreamt of passing through walls. Sometimes I
succeeded, other times I failed. When failing, I would remind myself:
Face the wall without fear or hesitation, dont force it, just calmly
walk through with a clear mind.</p>
<p>In my dream last night, I added some more details. The bed I slept on
was made of wooden planks, not a proper bed, and it was placed right
against the south mud wall of the house. The area where the mud wall and
the bed touched was covered with newspapers to prevent dirt from the
wall from falling onto the bed.</p>
<p>On the north side of the room where I slept was a stove, with the
side for burning fire facing west, the pot platform [The side of the
stove that is closest to the pot] on the east, next to a large water
jar. There was a small window near the pot platform.</p>
<p>While sleeping, my head was facing east, next to a pillar that was
covered with various hanging items, as was the beam above it.</p>
<p>My feet were facing west, about 1.5 meters away from where my parents
slept. The aliens entered from this 1.5-meter section of the mud wall,
and we left through it too.</p>
<p>My parents room door was also not far from this spot. Back then, the
floor of the entire house was earthen, not cement.</p>
<p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2024/08/21/VpPSFgDzd4TErJR.png" width="435" height="580"></p>
<p>Its been 37 years since then, and many of my memories have become
blurry. I hope netizens can forgive me. Currently, many people doubt and
attack me, and Im under a lot of pressure. I hope for understanding from
the netizens.</p>
<p>I am certain that I encountered aliens in 1985 because I wrote many
letters at the time, stating I was 19 years old. According to our rural
calculations, being born in 1967 meant it should be 1985. Its not that I
checked the calendar upon my return; I didnt have the intention to seek
evidence then.</p>
<p>Many of the letters I wrote later were lost. Some netizens asked me
to find these letters. Recently, I went to my old home and found a
few.</p>
<p>Seeing these letters brings bitterness to my heart. I didnt expect
that after 37 years, I would still be in such a wretched state.</p>
<p>For 37 years, much of what has happened seems like a dream. Under
many peoples doubts and intense attacks, I sometimes force myself to
consider it all just a dream.</p>
<p>However, these letters pull me back to reality. For 37 years, I have
been writing letters, trying to communicate this incident to the outside
world. Could this act of writing letters also be just an illusion?</p>
<h2 id="the-origin-of-my-name">The origin of my name</h2>
<p>In my long-term promotion of alien Artificial Field Scanning
technology, many Chinese traditional culture enthusiasts and I Ching<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> lovers were very interested in
me.</p>
<p>Some people asked me to report my birth date and eight characters,
they wanted to tell my fortune. Some people also wanted to tell my
fortune by my appearance.</p>
<p>Someone asked why my name is Zhang Xiangqian.</p>
<p>The most frequently asked question is: Zhang Xiangqian, when will you
succeed?</p>
<p>When my brother was not yet born, my maternal uncle came and told my
father that if it were a boy, he would be called Zhang Xianglong<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, and if he would have a younger
brother in the future, he would be called Zhang Xianghu<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.
Xiang is our seniority in the clan (beifen)<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The order of beifen indicated on our Zhang family’s genealogy is:</p>
<p>Da, Xue, Zhi, Dao, Xian, Hou, Xiang, Ming<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>My grandfather’s beifen was Xian, my father’s was Hou, and when it
comes to me and my brother, we must be the Xiang generation.</p>
<p>Now in my sons generation, no one treats beifen as a matter of time,
and their names are not called strictly according to the genealogy.</p>
<p>My maternal uncle used to be the captain of the Eighth Route Army<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>. He was too upright and offended
someone. During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the subsequent
turmoil, he was tricked, encountered assassination and injured. He died
soon from illness and hunger.</p>
<p>When my brother was born, someone said that the name given by my
maternal uncle didnt sound good.</p>
<p>Our neighbor was a barber, and his father came from a private school
(sishu<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>). He believes that in the future,
the country needs educated people, and only they can stabilize the
country. So, when my brother was born, he suggested that the name be
Zhang Xiangan<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>. My father accepted this
suggestion. So, my brothers name is Zhang Xiangan now.</p>
<p>After I was born, according to the advice of the person who graduated
from the private school, I should be called Zhang Xiangbang. If there is
another younger brother named Zhang Xiangding, then there is another
younger brother named Zhang Xiangguo<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Not long after I was born, my mother hugged me and basked in the sun
at the door, and many villagers around me were also sunbathing. While
everyone was asking what my name was, a strange old man came and told my
fortune by looking at my face. When he saw me, he was shocked and said,
“This child has grown up to be very wealthy.”</p>
<p>People around him asked, “How wealthy?”</p>
<p>“This man can earn all the money in the world, and in the future,
everyone wont have to earn money or work anymore. They can all live a
good life. I think this child will have half of the money in the
world.”</p>
<p>Everyone around laughed and none believed his words.</p>
<p>This physiognomy asked my mother if she had given me a name and what
my name was.</p>
<p>My mother told him that my name was Zhang Xiangbang.</p>
<p>The physiognomy quickly said that it was inappropriate and suggested
changing my name to Zhang Xiangqian (张祥钱)<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Later on, the old man was extremely accurate when he told fortune of
several people around him. It was only then that we felt that he was
very magical. Later, my family named me Zhang Xiangqian (张祥钱).</p>
<p>When I was in primary school, I was in first grade. Our Chinese
teacher was Yang Xiaomei. She was a knowledgeable young woman down here
from Shanghai<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>, who was very beautiful and dressed
very cleanly.</p>
<p>She probably thought my name was very rustic, so she changed my name
to Zhang Xiangqian (张祥前)<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> without my consent.
It’s also possible that when I reported my name, she just wrote my name
based on the pronunciation. At that time, people were not as serious as
now.</p>
<p>At that time, because my family was too poor, I often wore tattered
clothes that didnt cover my body. My classmates even bullied me,
deliberately pulling on my torn clothes, making me even more
embarrassed.</p>
<p>Ms. Yang scolded those students and protected me. I was very grateful
for this. My family told me that Ms. Yang wrote my name wrong and asked
me to tell her and change it. But when I saw her, I was always shy and
hesitant to speak up.</p>
<p>I have always thought, if Ms. Yang hadnt changed my name back then,
my name would have been Zhang Xiangqian (张祥钱). Would I really be one
of the worlds richest people now?</p>
<p>I think its actually possible. The Artificial Field Scanning
technology I bring can replace electricity on Earth. In 2021, Chinas
electricity consumption exceeded 4 trillion kilowatt-hours<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, while global electricity
consumption reached one hundred billion<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Artificial field scanning technology can also produce drastic changes
in various fields such as energy, transportation, tourism, construction,
medical care, biology, industrial manufacturing, electric
transportation, information processing, education, nuclear physics,
aerospace, and interstellar flight.</p>
<p>I was born in the year of Sheep, August 26, 1967, probably in the
morning. My parents are both dead now, so I never thought of asking
about this before.</p>
<p>Every time when August 26th of the lunar calendar comes, people
forget my birthday. I have no status in the family, and my wife often
scolds me in front of the children like scolding a dog. Therefore, my
family never cared about my birthday and no one mentioned it.</p>
<p>My relatives think of me mostly because I own an electric tricycle
and maybe they need to move something. Normally, my presence is like
air.</p>
<p>As for when I will succeed and when Artificial Field Scanning will
gain the attention of society, some experts predict that I will succeed
in 2025.</p>
<p>Why do I believe this expert? Because all his predictions have been
verified, and he was not the only one who predicted that I would succeed
in 2025.</p>
<p>Some people may wonder, why you, Zhang Xiangqian, are interested in
superstitious things such as physiognomy, fortune telling, and prophecy
when studying Unified Field Theory and promoting Artificial Field
Scanning, all of which are scientific.</p>
<p>The desire to gain social attention is related to peoples persistent
promotion of Artificial Field technology, as well as luck.</p>
<p>There are two reasons here. One is:</p>
<p>No matter how good science and technology are, they need to be valued
by society and developed and applied, before they can generate value.
Without attention, no one can develop them, which is equivalent to
nothing, no effect. There is no intermediate state.</p>
<p>Getting social attention is related to peoples persistent promotion
of Artificial Field technology, as well as luck.</p>
<p>Although I believe in physiognomy, fortune-telling, and prophecy, I
believe that the future contains infinite possibilities. physiognomy and
prophecy are not things that must happen in the future, but rather have
a relatively high probability of occurrence. Its not that absolute or
100% certain things must happen.</p>
<p>By 2025, Artificial Field Scanning will receive social attention,
with a possibility of perhaps 80%. My current efforts, not daring to
slack off at all, are aimed at eliminating the 20% possibility.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible that my luck is not good, and everyones luck
is not good. It’s also possible that the 20% won’t be eliminated.</p>
<p>Another reason is that I believe prophecy may have some scientific
basis, not entirely superstition.</p>
<p>I pointed out in my work <em>Space Information Field Theory</em> that
any space in the universe can contain all the information of the entire
universe in the past, now, and in the future.</p>
<p>Time is just a feeling of human beings that the space around us, the
observers, diverges and moves at the speed of light. If it werent for
us, time would not exist, nor would sequence exist. If we, human
observers, do not exist, time does not exist, and order also does not
exist. The information about everything that happened billions of years
ago and billions of years later would overlap at a single point in
space.</p>
<p>Perhaps prophets make accurate predictions by capturing hidden
information in space, especially future information. I believe it’s the
scientific basis for prophetic predictions.</p>
<p>We live in an infinite universe, which contains endless
possibilities, and everything is possible in the future.</p>
<p>My attitude is: I would rather have done it than missed it.</p>
<h2 id="the-advanced-alien-technologies">The advanced alien
technologies</h2>
<p>Recently, an netizen told me, “Zhang Xiangqian, you always promote
your advanced alien technology theory online. If it is true, I can
arrange for someone to bring you to Beijing and arrange funds and teams
to cooperate with you. However, we need to sign a contract. If you dont
achieve anything within 5 years, you, Zhang Xiangqian are willing to
accept the death penalty yourself! If you dare not reply to me, please
be more knowledgeable and dont always promote your damn advanced
technology online.”</p>
<p>In todays society, scammers are rampant in the field of scientific
research, and only one or two people out of a bunch of scammers may have
truly achieved scientific results. The above words cannot be said too
much.</p>
<p>I would like to provide the following response to him:</p>
<p>I can basically agree with this mans proposal. However, once I fail,
I can accept the punishment of fixed-term imprisonment or life
imprisonment, not the death penalty. Because there are too many bad
people in China, I may be interfered with by them during the research
and development, which may cause artificial delay.</p>
<p>A persons life is only once, but even in prison, I can still think
about these advanced theories.</p>
<p>The advanced alien technology brought by Zhang Xiangqian mainly
includes the following parts:</p>
<p><strong>1, Create UFOs that can fly at the speed of
light.</strong></p>
<p>There are two completely different ways of motion in nature, one is
the ordinary acceleration motion with speed changing over time, and the
other is the motion with mass changing over time (such as movement
accompanied by light<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>). The alien UFO is actually based
on the principle of motion with mass changing over time.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>2, Artificial Field</strong></p>
<p>The deciphering of the essence of the field can enable humans to
create a special Artificial Field, which can allow people to pass
through walls, with both the person and the wall intact. <a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Artificial fields can also enable large-scale use of cold welding,
increasing the speed of building, engineering, and industrial
manufacturing by a hundred times, and reducing the costs by a hundred
times. Miracles can be created in various aspects of human production,
life, healthcare, and more.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>3, Artificial Information Field</strong></p>
<p>Artificial Field working under the control of electronic computer
programs, is called Artificial Information Field.</p>
<p>Artificial Information Field can perform functions such as cold
welding, excitation, and heating on the human body, as well as
high-speed cutting and handling. They can also perform precise and batch
operations on molecules and atoms.</p>
<p>Artificial information fields can also be used for surgery inside the
human body without affecting the external. During the surgery, objects
can be removed from the inside of the human body without the need for an
abdominal incision<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>These incredible capabilities of the Artificial Information Field, as
well as the perfect combination with the electronic computer, can enable
human beings to thoroughly treat cancer, hypertension, diabetes,
Alzheimers disease, and other chronic diseases, and can enable human
beings to enter a drug-free era.</p>
<p>The effect of the Artificial Information Field on weight loss,
plastic surgery, and sculpting human body shape is incredible, and
patients are painless.</p>
<p><strong>4, Instant disappearing movement-- Global Movement
Network</strong></p>
<p><em>Unified Field Theory</em><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> predicts a
discontinuous instantaneous disappearing motion -- mass-adding motion<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. The Global Movement Network is
built on the principle of discontinuous, instantaneous disappearing
movement. It allows people and goods to appear anywhere in the world,
including in a sealed room, within a second.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>5, Global Large-Scale Conductor Free
Conductivity</strong></p>
<p>It uses pure vacuum to conduct electricity, with low energy
dissipation and almost no impact on the environment. Electrical
appliances can receive electrical energy as long as they are connected
to a closed coil. When the coil is disconnected, there is no electricity
left, which is convenient for control.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>6, Convergence Solar Receiver</strong></p>
<p>It can accept tens of thousands of square meters of solar energy per
square meter, solving the human energy crisis, and the energy is cheap,
almost free.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Gathering solar energy receivers can also artificially reduce the
solar energy in a certain area, combined with electronic computer
analysis, to effectively control and regulate the weather, avoiding the
occurrence of harmful weather.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>7, Infinite Compressible Space Storage and Information
Transmission Technology</strong></p>
<p>Any space in the universe can store the entire universes information,
and space can be infinitely compressed. The technology of storing and
transmitting information in infinitely compressed space is an upgrade of
human information technology.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>8, Field Scanning Technology for Consciousness Reading and
Storage</strong></p>
<p>Human consciousness and thinking are caused by the movement of
charged particles in the human brain, which can cause disturbance
effects on the space.</p>
<p>The Unified Field Theory reveals the essence and form of this
disturbance. </p>
<p>In the human brain, using the intangible substances “Field” to
penetrate deep into the brain, scanning and recording these spatial
disturbance effects, can read and record human consciousness and memory,
thereby further copying human consciousness information and storing it
in electronic computers. When human technology develops to a certain
extent in the future, the consciousness information will be installed on
a certain organism to clear technological barriers for immortality.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>This field scanning technology can also change the education mode,
delivering knowledge, such as rote memorization knowledge, to the human
brain at high speed, greatly reducing learning time. <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>It
also makes it possible to connect the human brain with computers and the
Internet.</p>
<p>Once the eight major applications predicted by the Unified Field
Theory are developed, they can revolutionize humanity. Most facilities
such as airplanes, ships, cars, power grids, power plants, highways,
airports, railways, and most bridges will disappear or be replaced by
more advanced things.</p>
<p>Due to the Global Movement Network, people and objects can appear
globally in just one second, and the pattern of cities and rural areas
will be changed. <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>Even if people live in the
countryside, they can rush to the city to work within a second.</p>
<p>The eight major applications of Unified Field Theory can eliminate
human competition for resources, eliminate global wars, poverty, and
diseases, and even require only one person out of ten thousand to work
in society.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>If someone invests in the development of these technologies, parts 4,
5, and 6 can succeed within a few years. However, due to the need to
develop complex software, it may take decades for 3 and 8 to succeed.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p><span id="Note"></span>Translators Note</p>
<p>There is relatively little evidence about Zhang Xiangqians visit to
alien planets. Currently, only the strange scar on his head (which he
said was not present before his visit), his drawings of extraterrestrial
creatures and scenes, and the formulas and memoirs he wrote after his
return. Although lacking more evidence, I deeply admire his persistence
in promoting the advanced alien technology he has seen for nearly 40
years, despite facing extreme difficulties in life. Many people believe
his persistence is due to mental problems, but I interviewed him in
person in 2023 and obtained a lot of evidence and information. I think
he is mentally normal. Apart from his extraterrestrial experience, he is
no different from any ordinary Anhui farmer.</p>
<p>This work is Zhang Xiangqians autobiography. The contents of Chapters
13 to 28 are some daily essays written by him, which are relatively
unimportant compared to the first 12 chapters. They also go beyond the
scope of an autobiography. The English translations of their titles are
listed in <em>Appendix I</em>.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been very busy with my masters studies and unable to
translate all of the contents due to lack of time and energy. I am
sincerely sorry about this. Readers who are interested in these contents
can read the original Chinese version (maybe via translation
software).</p>
<p>His works are listed in <em>Appendix II</em>. Among them, the four
articles <em>The Society and Daily Life of Aliens (1 and 2)</em>,
<em>Revealing the Mystery of UFO,</em> and <em>Zhang Xiangqians
Predictions for the Future</em> are some of his essays and summaries of
alien technology. <em>An Adventure to Guoker Planet</em> is a “travel
diary” that he has been recalling and compiling for more than thirty
years, which is about his experience of being taken to an alien planet
and living for a month in 1985. It includes all aspects of an alien
galaxy civilization called “Guoker Planet”, including its technological
level, ideology, food, clothing, housing, transportation, and many other
details. It is his most important work in my opinion.</p>
<p>The technological level of the Guoker planet described by him is
thousands of years ahead of the Earth. A persons life is only a hundred
years, so short in comparison. Im afraid I wont be able to see the day
when these technologies come true in my lifetime. However, I still hope
to make my contribution to scientific progress, which is why I
voluntarily translated Zhang Xiangqians works.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reading and support.</p>

<p>In his work <em>Uncovering the Mystery of UFO,</em> he said that UFO
is driven by an artificial gravitational field generated by a large
number of charged particles accelerating along the circumference
(therefore UFOs are circular). And charged particles are driven by
nuclear energy.<a href="#fnref21" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em>,
due to the huge gap between the atomic nucleus and electrons, their
Artificial Field technology allows two objects to pass through each
other without getting damaged.<a href="#fnref22" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker,</em>
the surfaces of UFOs and extraterrestrial buildings are extremely
smooth, without any welds. They are manufactured using this cold welding
technology.<a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em>,
this extraterrestrial surgical equipment is as big as a house, and
patients are transported inside, like an MRI machine on Earth.<a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>Another work by Zhang Xiangqian mainly introduces the
alien physics theories and formulas he compiled and understood.<a href="#fnref25" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>It refers to the motion that an objects mass changes
over time, as mentioned earlier in part 1.<a href="#fnref26" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em>,
the generator, control center, and global information processing center
of the Global Movement Network are all integrated into a huge silver
artificial satellite. There are 9 such satellites on Guoker Planet and 6
on some small planets, and he has also visited one of the centers. The
effect is similar to instant movement, but (the translator speculates)
it’s just a kind of extremely high-speed movement.<a href="#fnref27" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>It may also be an application of Artificial Field
(speculated by the translator).<a href="#fnref28" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker,</em>
this device is also installed on huge artificial satellites. “The
converging solar receiver is a huge flat panel with many circles
distributed, which seem to be drawn on the panel. There is a black dot
in the middle of each circle, which may be a hole or something else made
and cannot be seen clearly from a distance.”<a href="#fnref29" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker,</em>
there is a powerful weather control system on Planet Guoker that uses
electronic computers to control global weather, resulting in mild
climates everywhere.<a href="#fnref30" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker,</em>
the Guoker people believe that using space to store information is the
ultimate way of storing information in the universe, and it is also the
most representative achievement of their high level technology.<a href="#fnref31" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em>,
the Guoker people back up their consciousness in electronic computers.
If the original body passes away due to an accident, a new body can be
reproduced in a huge body replication factory to download the original
consciousness. Utilizing this technology, the lifespan of the Guoker
people can reach up to a thousand years, even almost unlimited.</p>
<p>They also think that the thoughts and consciousness of different
Earthlings are mostly similar, with only a crucial one-fifth being
different. So, we only needs to store the critical one-fifth of the
information for each Earthling.<a href="#fnref32" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em>,
the brain of Guoker people can not only access knowledge in real-time
through the internet, but also store memory outside the body, and
download knowledge to the brain for learning. But they cannot download
too much knowledge at once, otherwise it will cause damage to the
brain.<a href="#fnref33" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em>,
there have been different countries and regimes in the history of the
Guoker people, but with the development of the global sports network,
the world has become highly integrated. Guoke Planet is a planetary
system with dozens of planets, each inhabited by aliens. It can be said
that the entire planetary system is just one country. The country does
not have a top leader, but is managed by various algorithmic protocols
to maintain their social order. The scientists who control these
protocols have larger power than normal people.<a href="#fnref34" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>According to <em>Adventures on the Planet Guoker</em>,
the entertainment activities occupy the vast majority of the Guoker
people’s daily life. The vast majority of people do not need to work,
and if they work, it even adds trouble to the society. Only a few elites
and scientists in their society are allowed and need to work. They
believe that if Earth technology develops to a certain extent, it will
also be similar.<a href="#fnref35" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>(The translator considers this idea too optimistic.)<a href="#fnref36" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
